      "about some debts, and one in particular, which she owed to a\r\n",
      "schoolmistress for Mary's schooling; and then she charged Mary to go and\r\n",
      "pay it, because she was not able to GO IN with it.  At the end of the\r\n",

      "families, who paid him a sixpence or a shilling, according to the\r\n",
      "distance which he went, so that Edmund, by some or other of these little\r\n",

      "Hopkins, an agent, who was a HARD MAN.*  The driver came to Mary about a\r\n",
      "week after her mother's death, and told her that the rent must be brought\r\n",
      "in the next day, and that she must leave the cabin, for a new tenant was\r\n",
      "coming into it; that she was too young to have a house to herself, and\r\n",

      "refused.  It was now September 25th, and he said that the new tenant must\r\n",

      "bear the thoughts of begging any of the neighbours to take her and her\r\n",
      "brother and sisters in FOR CHARITY'S SAKE; for the neighbours were all\r\n",

      "shelter in the ruins of the old castle of Rossmore where she and her\r\n",
      "brother, in better times, had often played at hide and seek.  The kitchen\r\n",
      "and two other rooms near it were yet covered in tolerably well; and a\r\n",
      "little thatch, she thought, would make them comfortable through the\r\n",
      "winter.  The agent consented to let her and her brother and sisters go in\r\n",

      "of meal.  The chest was carried for them by some of the charitable\r\n",

      "to graze upon his bit of land on condition of having half the milk; and\r\n",

      "into the castle, was part of what she had to pay to the schoolmistress,\r\n",
      "to whom above a guinea was due.  Mary went to her, and took her goat\r\n",
      "along with her, and offered it in part of payment of the debt, but the\r\n",
      "schoolmistress would not receive the goat. She said that she could afford\r\n",
      "to wait for her money till Mary was able to pay it; that she knew her to\r\n",
      "be an honest, industrious little girl, and she would trust her with more\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Isabella and Caroline (so these ladies were called) would not disturb the\r\n",
      "poor children; but they stopped in the village to inquire about them.  It\r\n",
      "was at the house of the schoolmistress that they stopped, and she gave\r\n",
      "them a good account of these orphans.  She particularly commended Mary's\r\n",
      "honesty, in having immediately paid all her mother's debts to the utmost\r\n",
      "farthing, as far as her money would go.  She told the ladies how Mary had\r\n",
      "been turned out of her house, and how she had offered her goat, of which\r\n",
      "she was very fond, to discharge a debt due for her schooling; and, in\r\n",
      "short, the schoolmistress, who had known Mary for several years, spoke so\r\n",
      "well of her that these ladies resolved that they would go to the old\r\n",
      "castle of Rossmore to see her the next day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they went there, they found the room in which the children lived as\r\n",
      "clean and neat as such a ruined place could be made.  Edmund was out\r\n",
      "working with a farmer, Mary was spinning, and her little sisters were\r\n",
      "measuring out some bogberries, of which they had gathered a basketful,\r\n",
      "for sale.  Isabella, after telling Mary what an excellent character she\r\n",
      "had heard of her, inquired what it was she most wanted; and Mary said\r\n",
      "that she had just worked up all her flax, and she was most in want of\r\n",
      "more flax for her wheel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Isabella promised that she would send her a fresh supply of flax, and\r\n",
      "Caroline bought the bogberries from the little girls, and gave them money\r\n",
      "enough to buy a pound of coarse cotton for knitting, as Mary said that\r\n",
      "she could teach them how to knit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The supply of flax, which Isabella sent the next day, was of great\r\n",
      "service to Mary, as it kept her in employment for above a month; and when\r\n",
      "she sold the yarn which she had spun with it, she had money enough to buy\r\n",
      "some warm flannel for winter wear.  Besides spinning well, she had\r\n",
      "learned at school to do plain work tolerably neatly, and Isabella and\r\n",
      "Caroline employed her to work for them; by which she earned a great deal\r\n",
      "more than she could by spinning.  At her leisure hours she taught her\r\n",
      "sisters to read and write; and Edmund, with part of the money which he\r\n",
      "earned by his work out of doors, paid a schoolmaster for teaching him a\r\n",
      "little arithmetic.  When the winter nights came on, he used to light his\r\n",
      "rush candles for Mary to work by.  He had gathered and stripped a good\r\n",
      "provision of rushes in the month of August, and a neighbour gave him\r\n",
      "grease to dip them in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One evening, just as he had lighted his candles, a footman came in, who\r\n",
      "was sent by Isabella with some plain work to Mary.  This servant was an\r\n",
      "Englishman, and he was but newly come over to Ireland.  The rush candles\r\n",
      "caught his attention; for he had never seen any of them before, as he\r\n",
      "came from a part of England where they were not used.  Edmund, who was\r\n",
      "ready to oblige, and proud that his candles were noticed showed the\r\n",
      "Englishman how they were made, and gave him a bundle of rushes.*\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[*\"The proper species of rush,\" says White, in his 'Natural History of\r\n",
      "Selborne,' \"seems to be the Juncus effusus, or common soft rush, which is\r\n",
      "to be found in moist pastures, by the sides of streams, and under\r\n",
      "hedges.  These rushes are in best condition in the height of summer, but\r\n",
      "may be gathered so as to serve the purpose well quite on to autumn.  The\r\n",
      "largest and longest are the best.  Decayed labourers, women, and children\r\n",
      "make it their business to procure and prepare them.  As soon as they are\r\n",
      "cut, they must be flung into water, and kept there; for otherwise they\r\n",
      "will dry and shrink, and the peel will not run.  When these junci are\r\n",
      "thus far prepared, they must lie out on the grass to be bleached and take\r\n",
      "the dew for some nights, and afterwards be dried in the sun.  Some\r\n",
      "address is required in dipping these rushes in the scalding fat or\r\n",
      "grease; but this knack is also to be attained by practice.  A pound of\r\n",
      "common grease may be procured for fourpence, and about six pounds of\r\n",
      "grease will dip a pound of rushes and one pound of rushes may be bought\r\n",
      "for one shilling; so that a pound of rushes, medicated and ready for use,\r\n",
      "will cost three shillings.\"]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The servant was pleased with his good nature in this trifling instance,\r\n",
      "and remembered it long after it was forgotten by Edmund.  Whenever his\r\n",
      "master wanted to send a messenger anywhere, Gilbert (for that was the\r\n",
      "servant's name) always employed his little friend Edmund, whom, upon\r\n",
      "further acquaintance, he liked better and better.  He found that Edmund\r\n",
      "was both quick and exact in executing commissions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day, after he had waited a great while at a gentleman's house for an\r\n",

      "answer, he did not attempt to make any excuse; he did not say, \"There was\r\n",
      "no answer, please your honour,\" or, \"They bid me not to wait,\" etc.; but\r\n",
      "he told exactly the truth; and though Gilbert scolded him for being so\r\n",
      "impatient as not to wait, yet his telling the truth was more to the boy's\r\n",
      "advantage than any excuse he could have made.  After this he was always\r\n",
      "believed when he said, \"There was no answer,\" or, \"They bid me not wait\";\r\n",
      "for Gilbert knew that he would not tell a lie to save himself from being\r\n",
      "scolded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The orphans continued to assist one another in their work according to\r\n",
      "their strength and abilities; and they went on in this manner for three\r\n",
      "years.  With what Mary got by her spinning and plain work, and Edmund by\r\n",
      "leading of cart-horses, going on errands, etc., and with little Peggy and\r\n",
      "Anne's earnings, the family contrived to live comfortably.  Isabella and\r\n",
      "Caroline often visited them, and sometimes gave them clothes, and\r\n",
      "sometimes flax or cotton for their spinning and knitting; and these\r\n",
      "children did not EXPECT, that because the ladies did something for them,\r\n",
      "they should do everything.  They did not grow idle or wasteful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Edmund was about twelve years old, his friend Gilbert sent for him\r\n",
      "one day, and told him that his master had given him leave to have a boy\r\n",
      "in the house to assist him, and that his master told him he might choose\r\n",
      "one in the neighbourhood.  Several were anxious to get into such a good\r\n",
      "place:  but Gilbert said that he preferred Edmund before them all,\r\n",
      "because he knew him to be an industrious, honest, good natured lad, who\r\n",
      "always told the truth.  So Edmund went into service at the vicarage; and\r\n",
      "his master was the father of Isabella and Caroline.  He found his new way\r\n",
      "of life very pleasant; for he was well fed, well clothed, and well\r\n",
      "treated; and he every day learned more of his business, in which at first\r\n",
      "he was rather awkward.  He was mindful to do all that Mr. Gilbert\r\n",
      "required of him; and he was so obliging to all his fellow-servants that\r\n",
      "they could not help liking him.  But there was one thing which was at\r\n",
      "first rather disagreeable to him:  he was obliged to wear shoes and\r\n",
      "stockings, and they hurt his feet.  Besides this, when he waited at\r\n",
      "dinner he made such a noise in walking that his fellow-servants laughed\r\n",
      "at him.  He told his sister Mary of his distress, and she made for him,\r\n",
      "after many trials, a pair of cloth shoes, with soles of platted hemp.*\r\n",
      "In these he could walk without making the least noise; and as these shoes\r\n",
      "could not be worn out of doors, he was always sure to change them before\r\n",

      "stairs or passages with his shoes.  When he was praised for these things,\r\n",
      "he said it was his sister Mary who should be thanked, and not he; and he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Isabella's maid bespoke a pair immediately, and sent Mary a piece of\r\n",
      "pretty calico for the outside.  The last-maker made a last for her, and\r\n",
      "over this Mary sewed the calico vamps tight.  Her brother advised her to\r\n",
      "try platted packthread instead of hemp for the soles; and she found that\r\n",
      "this looked more neat than the hemp soles, and was likely to last longer.\r\n",
      "She platted the packthread together in strands of about half an inch\r\n",
      "thick, and these were served firmly together at the bottom of the shoe.\r\n",
      "When they were finished they fitted well, and the maid showed them to her\r\n",

      "Isabella and Caroline were so well pleased with Mary's ingenuity and\r\n",
      "kindness to her brother, that they bespoke from her two dozen of these\r\n",
      "shoes, and gave her three yards of coloured fustian to make them of, and\r\n",
      "galloon for the binding.  When the shoes were completed, Isabella and\r\n",
      "Caroline disposed of them for her amongst their acquaintance, and got\r\n",
      "three shillings a pair for them.  The young ladies, as soon as they had\r\n",
      "collected the money, walked to the old castle, where they found\r\n",
      "everything neat and clean as usual.  They had great pleasure in giving to\r\n",
      "this industrious girl the reward of her ingenuity, which she received\r\n",
      "with some surprise and more gratitude.  They advised her to continue the\r\n",

      "another helped Peggy and Anne to baste in the linings; and all who could\r\n",
      "get employment were pleased, for the idle ones were shoved out of the\r\n",
      "way.  It became a custom with the children of the village to resort to\r\n",
      "the old castle at their play hours; and it was surprising to see how much\r\n",
      "was done by ten or twelve of them, each doing but a little at a time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One morning Edmund and the little manufacturers were assembled very\r\n",
      "early, and they were busy at their work, all sitting round the meal\r\n",
      "chest, which served them for a table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My hands must be washed,\" said George, a little boy who came running in;\r\n",
      "\"I ran so fast that I might be in time, to go to work along with you all,\r\n",
      "that I tumbled down, and look how I have dirtied my hands.  Most haste\r\n",
      "worst speed.  My hands must be washed before I can do anything.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whilst George was washing his hands, two other little children, who had\r\n",
      "just finished their morning's work, came to him to beg that he would blow\r\n",
      "some soap bubbles for them, and they were all three eagerly blowing\r\n",
      "bubbles, and watching them mount into the air, when suddenly they were\r\n",
      "startled by a noise as loud as thunder.  They were in a sort of outer\r\n",
      "court of the castle, next to the room in which all their companions were\r\n",
      "at work, and they ran precipitately into the room, exclaiming, \"Did you\r\n",
      "hear that noise?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought I heard a clap of thunder,\" said Mary, \"but why do you look so\r\n",
      "frightened?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she finished speaking, another and a louder noise, and the walls round\r\n",
      "about them shook.  The children turned pale and stood motionless; but\r\n",
      "Edmund threw down his hammer, and ran out to see what was the matter.\r\n",
      "Mary followed him, and they saw that a great chimney of the old ruins at\r\n",
      "the farthest side of the castle had fallen down, and this was the cause\r\n",
      "of the prodigious noise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The part of the castle in which they lived seemed, as Edmund said, to be\r\n",
      "perfectly safe; but the children of the village were terrified, and\r\n",
      "thinking that the whole would come tumbling down directly, they ran to\r\n",
      "their homes as fast as they could.  Edmund, who was a courageous lad, and\r\n",
      "proud of showing his courage, laughed at their cowardice; but Mary, who\r\n",
      "was very prudent, persuaded her brother to ask an experienced mason, who\r\n",
      "was building at his master's, to come and give his opinion, whether their\r\n",
      "part of the castle was safe to live in or not.  The mason came, and gave\r\n",
      "it as his opinion that the rooms they inhabited might last through the\r\n",
      "winter but that no part of the ruins could stand another year.  Mary was\r\n",
      "sorry to leave a place of which she had grown fond, poor as it was,\r\n",
      "having lived in it in peace and contentment ever since her mother's\r\n",
      "death, which was now nearly four years; but she determined to look out\r\n",
      "for some other place to live in; and she had now money enough to pay the\r\n",
      "rent of a comfortable cabin.  Without losing any time, she went to the\r\n",
      "village that was at the end of the avenue leading to the vicarage, for\r\n",
      "she wished to get a lodging in this village because it was so near to her\r\n",
      "brother, and to the ladies who had been so kind to her.  She found that\r\n",
      "there was one newly built house in this village unoccupied; it belonged\r\n",
      "to Mr. Harvey, her landlord, who was still in England; it was slated, and\r\n",
      "neatly fitted up inside; but the rent of it was six guineas a year, and\r\n",
      "this was far above what Mary could afford to pay.  Three guineas a year\r\n",
      "she thought was the highest rent for which she could venture to engage.\r\n",
      "Besides, she heard that several proposals had been made to Mr. Harvey for\r\n",
      "this house, and she knew that Mr. Hopkins, the agent, was not her friend;\r\n",
      "therefore she despaired of getting it.  There was no other to be had in\r\n",
      "this village.  Her brother was still more vexed than she was, that she\r\n",
      "could not find a place near him.  He offered to give a guinea yearly\r\n",
      "towards the rent out of his wages; and Mr. Gilbert spoke about it for him\r\n",
      "to the steward, and inquired whether, amongst any of those who had given\r\n",
      "in proposals, there might not be one who would be content with a part of\r\n",
      "the house, and who would join with Mary in paying the rent.  None could\r\n",
      "be found but a woman, who was a great scold, and a man who was famous for\r\n",
      "going to law about every trifle with his neighbours.  Mary did not choose\r\n",
      "to have anything to do with these people.  She did not like to speak\r\n",
      "either to Miss Isabella or Caroline about it, because she was not of an\r\n",
      "encroaching temper; and when they had done so much for her, she would\r\n",
      "have been ashamed to beg for more.  She returned home to the old castle,\r\n",
      "mortified that she had no good news to tell Anne and Peggy, who she knew\r\n",
      "expected to hear that she had found a nice house for them in the village\r\n",
      "near their brother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bad news for you, Peggy,\" cried she, as soon as she got home.  \"And bad\r\n",
      "news for you, Mary,\" replied her sisters, who looked very sorrowful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's the matter?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your poor goat is dead,\" replied Peggy.  \"There she is, yonder, lying\r\n",
      "under the great corner stone; you can just see her leg.  We cannot lift\r\n",
      "the stone from off her, it is so heavy.  Betsy [one of the neighbour's\r\n",
      "girls] says she remembers, when she came to us to work early this\r\n",
      "morning, she saw the goat rubbing itself, and butting with its horns\r\n",
      "against that old tottering chimney.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Many's the time,\" said Mary, \"that I have driven the poor thing away\r\n",
      "from that place; I was always afraid she would shake that great ugly\r\n",
      "stone down upon her at last.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The goat, who had long been the favourite of Mary and her sisters, was\r\n",
      "lamented by them all.  When Edmund came, he helped them to move the great\r\n",
      "stone from off the poor animal, who was crushed so as to be a terrible\r\n",
      "sight.  As they were moving away this stone in order to bury the goat,\r\n",
      "Anne found an odd-looking piece of money, which seemed neither like a\r\n",
      "halfpenny, nor a shilling, nor a guinea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here are more, a great many more of them,\" cried Peggy; and upon\r\n",
      "searching amongst the rubbish, they discovered a small iron pot, which\r\n",
      "seemed as if it had been filled with these coins, as a vast number of\r\n",
      "them were found about the spot where it fell.  On examining these coins,\r\n",
      "Edmund thought that several of them looked like gold, and the girls\r\n",
      "exclaimed with great joy--\"Oh, Mary! Mary! this is come to us just in\r\n",
      "right time--now you can pay for the slated house.  Never was anything so\r\n",
      "lucky!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mary, though nothing could have pleased her better than to have been\r\n",
      "able to pay for the house, observed that they could not honestly touch\r\n",
      "any of this treasure, as it belonged to the owner of the castle.  Edmund\r\n",
      "agreed with her, that they ought to carry it all immediately to Mr.\r\n",
      "Hopkins, the agent. Peggy and Anne were convinced by what Mary said, and\r\n",
      "they begged to go along with her and their brother, to take the coins to\r\n",
      "Mr. Hopkins.  On their way they stopped at the vicarage, to show the\r\n",
      "treasure to Mr. Gilbert, who took it to the young ladies, Isabella and\r\n",
      "Caroline, and told them how it had been found.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is not only by their superior riches, but it is yet more by their\r\n",
      "superior knowledge, that persons in the higher rank of life may assist\r\n",
      "those in a lower condition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Isabella, who had some knowledge of chemistry, discovered, by touching\r\n",
      "the coins with nitric acid, that several of them were of gold, and\r\n",
      "consequently of great value.  Caroline also found out that many of the\r\n",
      "coins were very valuable as curiosities.  She recollected her father's\r\n",
      "having shown to her the prints of the coins at the end of each king's\r\n",
      "reign, in \"Rapin's History of England;\" and upon comparing these\r\n",
      "impressions with the coins found by the orphans, she perceived that many\r\n",
      "of them were of the reign of Henry the Seventh, which, from their\r\n",
      "scarcity, were highly appreciated by numismatic collectors.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Isabella and Caroline, knowing something of the character of Mr. Hopkins,\r\n",
      "the agent, had the precaution to count the coins, and to mark each of\r\n",
      "them with a cross, so small that it was scarcely visible to the naked\r\n",
      "eye, though it was easily to be seen through a magnifying glass.  They\r\n",
      "also begged that their father, who was well acquainted with Mr. Harvey,\r\n",
      "the gentleman to whom Rossmore Castle belonged, to write to him, and tell\r\n",
      "him how well these orphans had behaved about the treasure which they had\r\n",
      "found.  The value of the coins was estimated at about thirty or forty\r\n",
      "guineas.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few days after the fall of the chimney at Rossmore Castle, as Mary and\r\n",
      "her sisters were sitting at their work, there came hobbling in an old\r\n",
      "woman, leaning on a crab stick, that seemed to have been newly cut.  She\r\n",
      "had a broken tobacco-pipe in her mouth; her head was wrapped up in two\r\n",
      "large red and blue handkerchiefs, with their crooked corners hanging far\r\n",
      "down over the back of her neck, no shoes on her broad feet, nor stockings\r\n",
      "on her many-coloured legs.  Her petticoat was jagged at the bottom, and\r\n",
      "the skirt of her gown turned up over her shoulders, to serve instead of a\r\n",
      "cloak, which she had sold for whisky.  This old woman was well known\r\n",
      "amongst the country people by the name of Goody Grope:*  because she had,\r\n",
      "for many years, been in the habit of groping in old castles, and in\r\n",
      "moats,** and at the bottom of a round tower*** in the neighbourhood, in\r\n",
      "search of treasure.  In her youth she had heard someone talking, in a\r\n",
      "whisper, of an old prophecy, found in a bog, which said that before many\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "     \"St. Patrick's days should come about,\r\n",
      "      There would be found\r\n",

      "      By one within twenty miles round.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "three times:  and as the dream, she thought, was a sure token that the\r\n",
      "prophecy was to come true, she, from that time forwards, gave up her\r\n",
      "spinning-wheel and her knitting, and could think of nothing but hunting\r\n",

      "and poorer.  Besides, to comfort herself for her disappointments, and to\r\n",
      "give her spirits for fresh searches, she took to drinking.  She sold all\r\n",
      "she had by degrees; but still she fancied that the lucky day would come\r\n",

      "shelter her, a bed to lie on, or food to put into her mouth, but what she\r\n",
      "begged from the charity of those who had trusted more than she had to\r\n",

      "wretched condition.  Goody Grope said she would rather have spirits of\r\n",
      "some kind or other than milk; but Mary had no spirits to give her; so she\r\n",
      "sat herself down close to the fire, and after she had sighed and groaned\r\n",
      "and smoked for some time, she said to Mary, \"Well, and what have you done\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "knew that if Goody Grope once set to work at the foundation of the old\r\n",
      "castle of Rossmore, she would soon bring it all down.  It was in vain to\r\n",
      "talk to Goody Grope of the danger of burying herself under the ruins, or\r\n",
      "of the improbability of her meeting with another pot of gold coins.  She\r\n",

      "children; so, not being as honest as they were, he resolved to keep it\r\n",
      "for his own use.  He was surprised some weeks afterwards to receive a\r\n",
      "letter from his employer, Mr. Harvey, demanding from him the coins which\r\n",
      "had been discovered at Rossmore Castle.  Hopkins had sold the gold coins,\r\n",
      "and some of the others; and he flattered himself that the children, and\r\n",
      "the young ladies, to whom he now found they had been shown, could not\r\n",
      "tell whether what they had seen were gold or not, and he was not in the\r\n",
      "least apprehensive that those of Henry the Seventh's reign should be\r\n",
      "reclaimed from him as he thought they had escaped attention.  So he sent\r\n",
      "over the silver coins and others of little value, and apologized for his\r\n",
      "not having mentioned them before, by saying that he considered them as\r\n",
      "mere rubbish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Harvey, in reply, observed that he could not consider as rubbish the\r\n",
      "gold coins which were amongst them when they were discovered; and he\r\n",
      "inquired why these gold coins, and those of the reign of Henry the\r\n",
      "Seventh, were not now sent to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Hopkins denied that he had ever received any such; but he was\r\n",

      "list of the coins which the orphans had deposited with him, and exact\r\n",
      "drawings of those that were missing.  He informed him that this list and\r\n",
      "these drawings came from two ladies who had seen the coins in question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Hopkins thought that he had no means of escape but by boldly\r\n",
      "persisting in falsehood.  He replied, that it was very likely such coins\r\n",
      "had been found at Rossmore Castle, and that the ladies alluded to had\r\n",
      "probably seen them; but he positively declared that they never came to\r\n",
      "his hands; that he had restored all that were deposited with him; and\r\n",
      "that, as to the others, he supposed they must have been taken out of the\r\n",

      "another in silence for some moments.  Then Peggy exclaimed--\"Sure!  Mr.\r\n",
      "Hopkins has forgotten himself strangely.  Does not he remember Edmund's\r\n",
      "counting the things to him upon the great table in his hall, and we all\r\n",
      "standing by!  I remember it as well as if it was this instant.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And so do I,\" cried Anne.  \"And don't you recollect, Mary, your picking\r\n",
      "out the gold ones, and telling Mr. Hopkins that they were gold; and he\r\n",
      "said you knew nothing of the matter; and I was going to tell him that\r\n",
      "Miss Isabella had tried them, and knew that they were gold? but just then\r\n",
      "there came in some tenants to pay their rent, and he pushed us out, and\r\n",

      "and put him in mind of all this.\"\r\n",

      "cast down--we are honest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"True,\" said Mary; \"but is not it a hard case that we, who have lived, as\r\n",
      "my mother did all her life before us, in peace and honesty with all the\r\n",
      "world, should now have our good name taken from us, when--\"  Mary's voice\r\n",

      "will, he can't hurt our good name.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Edmund was mistaken, alas! and Mary had but too much reason for her\r\n",
      "fears.  The affair was a great deal talked of; and the agent spared no\r\n",
      "pains to have the story told his own way.  The orphans, conscious of\r\n",
      "their own innocence, took no pains about the matter; and the consequence\r\n",
      "was, that all who knew them well had no doubt of their honesty; but many,\r\n",
      "who knew nothing of them, concluded that the agent must be in the right\r\n",
      "and the children in the wrong.  The buzz of scandal went on for some time\r\n",
      "without reaching their ears, because they lived very retiredly.  But one\r\n",
      "day, when Mary went to sell some stockings of Peggy's knitting at the\r\n",
      "neighbouring fair, the man to whom she sold them bid her write her name\r\n",
      "on the back of a note, and exclaimed, on seeing it--\"Ho! ho! mistress;\r\n",
      "I'd not have had any dealings with you, had I known your name sooner.\r\n",
      "Where's the gold that you found at Rossmore Castle?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was in vain that Mary related the fact.  She saw that she gained no\r\n",
      "belief, as her character was not known to this man, or to any of those\r\n",
      "who were present.  She left the fair as soon as she could; and though she\r\n",
      "struggled against it, she felt very melancholy.  Still she exerted\r\n",
      "herself every day at her little manufacture; and she endeavoured to\r\n",
      "console herself by reflecting that she had two friends left who would not\r\n",
      "give up her character, and who continued steadily to protect her and her\r\n",
      "sisters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Isabella and Caroline everywhere asserted their belief in the integrity\r\n",
      "of the orphans, but to prove it was in this instance out of their power.\r\n",
      "Mr. Hopkins, the agent, and his friends, constantly repeated that the\r\n",
      "gold coins were taken away in coming from their house to his; and these\r\n",
      "ladies were blamed by many people for continuing to countenance those\r\n",
      "that were, with great reason, suspected to be thieves.  The orphans were\r\n",
      "in a worse condition than ever when the winter came on, and their\r\n",
      "benefactresses left the country to spend some months in Dublin.  The old\r\n",
      "castle, it was true, was likely to last through the winter, as the mason\r\n",
      "said; but though the want of a comfortable house to live in was, a little\r\n",
      "while ago, the uppermost thing in Mary's thoughts, now it was not so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One night as Mary was going to bed, she heard someone knocking hard at\r\n",
      "the door.  \"Mary, are you up? let us in,\" cried a voice, which she knew\r\n",
      "to be the voice of Betsy Green, the postmaster's daughter, who lived in\r\n",
      "the village near them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She let Betsy in, and asked what she could want at such a time of night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Give me sixpence, and I'll tell you,\" said Betsy; \"but waken Anne and\r\n",
      "Peggy.  Here's a letter just come by post for you, and I stepped over to\r\n",
      "you with it; because I guessed you'd be glad to have it, seeing it is\r\n",
      "your brother's handwriting.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"DEAR MARY, NANCY, AND LITTLE PEG,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Joy! joy!--I always said the truth would come out at last; and that he\r\n",
      "could not take our good name from us.  But I will not tell you how it all\r\n",
      "came about till we meet, which will be next week, as we are (I mean,\r\n",
      "master and mistress, and the young ladies--bless them!--and Mr. Gilbert\r\n",
      "and I) coming down to the vicarage to keep Christmas; and a happy\r\n",
      "Christmas 'tis likely to be for honest folks.  As for they that are not\r\n",
      "honest, it is not for them to expect to be happy, at Christmas, or any\r\n",
      "other time.  You shall know all when we meet.  So, till then, fare ye\r\n",
      "well, dear Mary, Nancy, and little Peg.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "To comprehend why Edmund is joyful, our readers must be informed of\r\n",
      "certain things which happened after Isabella and Caroline went to Dublin.\r\n",
      "One morning they went with their father and mother to see the magnificent\r\n",
      "library of a nobleman, who took generous and polite pleasure in thus\r\n",
      "sharing the advantages of his wealth and station with all who had any\r\n",
      "pretensions to science or literature.  Knowing that the gentleman who was\r\n",
      "now come to see his library was skilled in antiquities, the nobleman\r\n",
      "opened a drawer of medals, to ask his opinion concerning the age of some\r\n",
      "coins, which he had lately purchased at a high price.  They were the very\r\n",
      "same which the orphans had found at Rossmore Castle.  Isabella and\r\n",
      "Caroline knew them again instantly; and as the cross which Isabella had\r\n",
      "made on each of them was still visible through a magnifying glass, there\r\n",
      "could be no possibility of doubt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The nobleman, who was much interested both by the story of these orphans,\r\n",
      "and the manner in which it was told to him, sent immediately for the\r\n",
      "person from whom he had purchased the coins.  He was a Jew broker.  At\r\n",
      "first he refused to tell them from whom he got them, because he had\r\n",
      "bought them, he said, under a promise of secrecy.  Being further pressed,\r\n",
      "he acknowledged that it was made a condition in his bargain that he\r\n",
      "should not sell them to anyone in Ireland, but that he had been tempted\r\n",
      "by the high price the present noble possessor had offered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last, when the Jew was informed that the coins were stolen, and that\r\n",
      "he would be proceeded against as a receiver of stolen goods, if he did\r\n",
      "not confess the whole truth, he declared that he had purchased them from\r\n",
      "a gentleman, whom he had never seen before or since; but he added, that\r\n",
      "he could swear to his person, if he saw him again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Mr. Hopkins, the agent, was at this time in Dublin, and Caroline's\r\n",
      "father posted the Jew, the next day, in the back-parlour of a banker's\r\n",
      "house, with whom Mr. Hopkins had, on this day, appointed to settle some\r\n",
      "accounts.  Mr. Hopkins came--the Jew knew him--swore that he was the man\r\n",
      "who had sold the coins to him; and thus the guilt of the agent and the\r\n",
      "innocence of the orphans were completely proved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A full account of all that happened was sent to England to Mr. Harvey,\r\n",
      "their landlord, and a few posts afterwards there came a letter from him,\r\n",
      "containing a dismissal of the dishonest agent, and a reward for the\r\n",
      "honest and industrious orphans.  Mr. Harvey desired that Mary and her\r\n",
      "sisters might have the slated house, rent free, from this time forward,\r\n",
      "under the care of ladies Isabella and Caroline, as long as Mary or her\r\n",

      "everybody saw that it was the reward of their good conduct; everybody\r\n",
      "except Goody Grope.  She exclaimed, as she wrung her hands with violent\r\n",

      "sooner to that there castle?  It is all luck, all luck in this world; but\r\n",
      "I never had no luck.  Think of the luck of these childer, that have found\r\n",
      "a pot of gold, and such great, grand friends, and a slated house, and\r\n",
      "all:  and here am I, with scarce a rag to cover me, and not a potato to\r\n",

      "LAZY LAWRENCE.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the pleasant valley of Ashton there lived an elderly woman of the name\r\n",
      "of Preston.  She had a small neat cottage, and there was not a weed to be\r\n",
      "seen in her garden.  It was upon her garden that she chiefly depended for\r\n",
      "support; it consisted of strawberry beds, and one small border for\r\n",
      "flowers.  The pinks and roses she tied up in nice nosegays, and sent\r\n",
      "either to Clifton or Bristol to be sold.  As to her strawberries, she did\r\n",
      "not send them to market, because it was the custom for numbers of people\r\n",
      "to come from Clifton, in the summer time, to eat strawberries and cream\r\n",
      "at the gardens in Ashton.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the widow Preston was so obliging, active and good-humoured, that\r\n",
      "everyone who came to see her was pleased.  She lived happily in this\r\n",
      "manner for several years; but, alas! one autumn she fell sick, and,\r\n",
      "during her illness, everything went wrong; her garden was neglected, her\r\n",
      "cow died, and all the money which she had saved was spent in paying for\r\n",
      "medicines. The winter passed away, while she was so weak that she could\r\n",
      "earn but little by her work; and when the summer came, her rent was\r\n",
      "called for, and the rent was not ready in her little purse as usual.  She\r\n",
      "begged a few months' delay, and they were granted to her; but at the end\r\n",
      "of that time there was no resource but to sell her horse Lightfoot.  Now\r\n",
      "Lightfoot, though perhaps he had seen his best days, was a very great\r\n",
      "favourite. In his youth he had always carried the dame to the market\r\n",
      "behind her husband; and it was now her little son Jem's turn to ride him.\r\n",
      "It was Jem's business to feed Lightfoot, and to take care of him--a\r\n",
      "charge which he never neglected, for, besides being a very good natured,\r\n",
      "he was a very industrious boy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It will go near to break my Jem's heart,\" said Dame Preston to herself,\r\n",
      "as she sat one evening beside the fire stirring the embers, and\r\n",
      "considering how she had best open the matter to her son, who stood\r\n",
      "opposite to her, eating a dry crust of bread very heartily for supper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Jem,\" said the old woman, \"what, ar't hungry?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That I am, brave and hungry!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ay! no wonder, you've been brave hard at work--Eh?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Brave hard!  I wish it was not so dark, mother, that you might just step\r\n",
      "out and see the great bed I've dug; I know you'd say it was no bad day's\r\n",
      "work--and oh, mother! I've good news:  Farmer Truck will give us the\r\n",
      "giant strawberries, and I'm to go for 'em tomorrow morning, and I'll be\r\n",
      "back afore breakfast.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"God bless the boy! how he talks!--Four mile there, and four mile back\r\n",
      "again, afore breakfast.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ay, upon Lightfoot, you know, mother, very easily; mayn't I?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ay, child!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why do you sigh, mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Finish thy supper, child.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've done!\" cried Jem, swallowing the last mouthful hastily, as if he\r\n",
      "thought he had been too long at supper--\"and now for the great needle; I\r\n",
      "must see and mend Lightfoot's bridle afore I go to bed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To work he set, by the light of the fire, and the dame having once more\r\n",
      "stirred it, began again with \"Jem, dear, does he go lame at all now?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What, Lightfoot!  Oh, la, no, not he--never was so well of his lameness\r\n",
      "in all his life.  He's grown quite young again, I think, and then he's so\r\n",
      "fat he can hardly wag.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"God bless him--that's right.  We must see, Jem, and keep him fat.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For what, mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For Monday fortnight at the fair.  He's to be--sold!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lightfoot!\" cried Jem, and let the bridle fall from his hand; \"and WILL\r\n",
      "mother sell Lightfoot?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"WILL? no:  but I MUST, Jem.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"MUST! who says you MUST? why MUST you, mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I must, I say, child.  Why, must not I pay my debts honestly; and must\r\n",
      "not I pay my rent, and was not it called for long and long ago; and have\r\n",
      "not I had time; and did not I promise to pay it for certain Monday\r\n",
      "fortnight, and am not I two guineas short; and where am I to get two\r\n",
      "guineas?  So what signifies talking, child?\" said the widow, leaning her\r\n",
      "head upon her arm.  \"Lightfoot MUST go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem was silent for a few minutes--\"Two guineas, that's a great, great\r\n",
      "deal.  If I worked, and worked, and worked ever so hard, I could no ways\r\n",
      "earn two guineas AFORE Monday fortnight--could I, mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lord help thee, no; not an' work thyself to death.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I could earn something, though, I say,\" cried Jem, proudly; \"and I\r\n",
      "WILL earn SOMETHING--if it be ever so little, it will be SOMETHING--and I\r\n",
      "shall do my very best; so I will.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That I'm sure of, my child,\" said his mother, drawing him towards her\r\n",
      "and kissing him; \"you were always a good, industrious lad, THAT I will\r\n",
      "say afore your face or behind your back;--but it won't do now--Lightfoot\r\n",
      "MUST go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem turned away struggling to hide his tears, and went to bed without\r\n",
      "saying a word more.  But he knew that crying would do no good; so he\r\n",
      "presently wiped his eyes, and lay awake, considering what he could\r\n",
      "possibly do to save the horse.  \"If I get ever so little,\" he still said\r\n",
      "to himself, \"it will be SOMETHING; and who knows but landlord might then\r\n",
      "wait a bit longer? and we might make it all up in time; for a penny a day\r\n",
      "might come to two guineas in time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But how to get the first penny was the question.  Then he recollected\r\n",
      "that one day, when he had been sent to Clifton to sell some flowers, he\r\n",
      "had seen an old woman with a board beside her covered with various\r\n",
      "sparkling stones, which people stopped to look at as they passed, and he\r\n",
      "remembered that some people bought the stones; one paid twopence, another\r\n",
      "threepence, and another sixpence for them; and Jem heard her say that she\r\n",
      "got them amongst the neighbouring rocks:  so he thought that if he tried\r\n",
      "he might find some too, and sell them as she had done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Early in the morning he wakened full of this scheme, jumped up, dressed\r\n",
      "himself, and, having given one look at poor Lightfoot in his stable, set\r\n",
      "off to Clifton in search of the old woman, to inquire where she found her\r\n",
      "sparkling stones.  But it was too early in the morning, the old woman was\r\n",
      "not at her seat; so he turned back again, disappointed.  He did not waste\r\n",
      "his time waiting for her, but saddled and bridled Lightfoot, and went to\r\n",
      "Farmer Truck's for the giant strawberries.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A great part of the morning was spent in putting them into the ground;\r\n",
      "and, as soon as that was finished, he set out again in quest of the old\r\n",
      "woman, whom, to his great joy, he spied sitting at her corner of the\r\n",
      "street with her board before her.  But this old woman was deaf and cross;\r\n",
      "and when at last Jem made her hear his questions, he could get no answer\r\n",
      "from her, but that she found the fossils where he would never find any\r\n",
      "more.  \"But can't I look where you looked?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Look away, nobody hinders you,\" replied the old woman; and these were\r\n",
      "the only words she would say.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem was not, however, a boy to be easily discouraged; he went to the\r\n",
      "rocks, and walked slowly along, looking at all the stones as he passed.\r\n",
      "Presently he came to a place where a number of men were at work loosening\r\n",
      "some large rocks, and one amongst the workmen was stooping down looking\r\n",
      "for something very eagerly; Jem ran up, and asked if he could help him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the man, \"you can; I've just dropped, amongst this heap of\r\n",
      "rubbish, a fine piece of crystal that I got to-day.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What kind of a looking thing is it?\" said Jem.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"White, and like glass,\" said the man, and went on working whilst Jem\r\n",
      "looked very carefully over the heap of rubbish for a great while.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come,\" said the man, \"it's gone for ever; don't trouble yourself any\r\n",
      "more, my boy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's no trouble; I'll look a little longer; we'll not give it up so\r\n",
      "soon,\" said Jem; and after he had looked a little longer, he found the\r\n",
      "piece of crystal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank'e,\" said the man, \"you are a fine little industrious fellow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem, encouraged by the tone of voice in which the man spoke this,\r\n",
      "ventured to ask him the same questions which he had asked the old woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"One good turn deserves another,\" said the man; \"we are going to dinner\r\n",
      "just now, and shall leave off work--wait for me here, and I'll make it\r\n",
      "worth your while.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem waited; and, as he was very attentively observing how the workmen\r\n",
      "went on with their work, he heard somebody near him give a great yawn,\r\n",
      "and, turning round, he saw stretched upon the grass, beside the river, a\r\n",
      "boy about his own age, who, in the village of Ashton, as he knew, went by\r\n",
      "the name of Lazy Lawrence--a name which he most justly deserved, for he\r\n",
      "never did anything from morning to night.  He neither worked nor played,\r\n",
      "but sauntered or lounged about restless and yawning.  His father was an\r\n",
      "ale-house keeper, and being generally drunk, could take no care of his\r\n",
      "son; so that Lazy Lawrence grew every day worse and worse.  However, some\r\n",
      "of the neighbours said that he was a good natured, poor fellow enough,\r\n",
      "and would never do anyone harm but himself; whilst others, who were\r\n",
      "wiser, often shook their heads, and told him that idleness was the root\r\n",
      "of all evil.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What, Lawrence!\" cried Jem to him, when he saw him lying upon the grass;\r\n",
      "\"what, are you asleep?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not quite.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Nothing.\"\r\n",

      "\"What makes you lie there?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know--because I can't find anybody to play with me to-day.  Will\r\n",
      "you come and play?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I can't; I'm busy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Busy,\" cried Lawrence, stretching himself, \"you are always busy.  I\r\n",
      "would not be you for the world, to have so much to do always.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I,\" said Jem, laughing, \"would not be you for the world, to have\r\n",
      "nothing to do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They then parted, for the workman just then called Jem to follow him.  He\r\n",
      "took him home to his own house, and showed him a parcel of fossils, which\r\n",
      "he had gathered, he said, on purpose to sell, but had never had time\r\n",
      "enough to sell them.  Now, however, he set about the task; and having\r\n",
      "picked out those which he judged to be the best, he put them in a small\r\n",
      "basket, and gave them to Jem to sell, upon condition that he should bring\r\n",
      "him half of what he got.  Jem, pleased to be employed, was ready to agree\r\n",
      "to what the man proposed, provided his mother had no objection.  When he\r\n",
      "went home to dinner, he told his mother his scheme, and she smiled, and\r\n",
      "said he might do as he pleased; for she was not afraid of his being from\r\n",
      "home.  \"You are not an idle boy,\" said she; \"so there is little danger of\r\n",
      "your getting into any mischief.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Accordingly Jem that evening took his stand, with his little basket, upon\r\n",
      "the bank of the river, just at the place where people land from a ferry-\r\n",
      "boat, and the walk turns to the wells, and numbers of people perpetually\r\n",
      "pass to drink the waters.  He chose his place well, and waited nearly all\r\n",
      "the evening, offering his fossils with great assiduity to every\r\n",
      "passenger; but not one person bought any.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hallo!\" cried some sailors, who had just rowed a boat to land, \"bear a\r\n",
      "hand here, will you, my little fellow, and carry these parcels for us\r\n",
      "into yonder house?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem ran down immediately for the parcels, and did what he was asked to do\r\n",
      "so quickly, and with so much good-will, that the master of the boat took\r\n",
      "notice of him, and, when he was going away, stopped to ask him what he\r\n",
      "had got in his little basket; and when he saw that they were fossils, he\r\n",
      "immediately told Jem to follow him, for that he was going to carry some\r\n",
      "shells he had brought from abroad to a lady in the neighbourhood who was\r\n",
      "making a grotto.  \"She will very likely buy your stones into the bargain.\r\n",
      "Come along, my lad; we can but try.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lady lived but a very little way off, so that they were soon at her\r\n",
      "house.  She was alone in her parlour, and was sorting a bundle of\r\n",
      "feathers of different colours; they lay on a sheet of pasteboard upon a\r\n",
      "window seat, and it happened that as the sailor was bustling round the\r\n",
      "table to show off his shells, he knocked down the sheet of pasteboard,\r\n",
      "and scattered all the feathers.  The lady looked very sorry, which Jem\r\n",
      "observing, he took the opportunity, whilst she was busy looking over the\r\n",
      "sailor's bag of shells, to gather together all the feathers, and sort\r\n",
      "them according to their different colours, as he had seen them sorted\r\n",
      "when he first came into the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where is the little boy you brought with you?  I thought I saw him here\r\n",
      "just now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And here I am, ma'am,\" cried Jem, creeping from under the table, with\r\n",
      "some few remaining feathers which he had picked from the carpet; \"I\r\n",
      "thought,\" added he, pointing to the others, \"I had better be doing\r\n",
      "something than standing idle, ma'am.\"  She smiled, and, pleased with his\r\n",
      "activity and simplicity, began to ask him several questions; such as who\r\n",
      "he was, where he lived, what employment he had, and how much a day he\r\n",
      "earned by gathering fossils.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This is the first day I ever tried,\" said Jem; \"I never sold any yet,\r\n",
      "and if you don't buy 'em now, ma'am, I'm afraid nobody else will; for\r\n",
      "I've asked everybody else.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come, then,\" said the lady, laughing, \"if that is the case, I think I\r\n",
      "had better buy them all.\"  So, emptying all the fossils out of his\r\n",
      "basket, she put half a crown into it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem's eyes sparkled with joy.  \"Oh, thank you, ma'am,\" said he, \"I will\r\n",
      "be sure and bring you as many more, to-morrow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but I don't promise you,\" said she, \"to give you half a crown, to-\r\n",
      "morrow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, perhaps, though you don't promise it, you will.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" said the lady, \"do not deceive yourself; I assure you that I will\r\n",
      "not.  THAT, instead of encouraging you to be industrious, would teach you\r\n",
      "to be idle.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem did not quite understand what she meant by this, but answered, \"I'm\r\n",
      "sure I don't wish to be idle; what I want is to earn something every day,\r\n",
      "if I know how; I'm sure I don't wish to be idle.  If you knew all, you'd\r\n",
      "know I did not.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How do you mean, IF I KNEW ALL?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, I mean, if you knew about Lightfoot.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who's Lightfoot?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, mammy's horse,\" added Jem, looking out of the window; \"I must make\r\n",
      "haste home, and feed him afore it gets dark; he'll wonder what's gone\r\n",
      "with me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let him wonder a few minutes longer,\" said the lady, \"and tell me the\r\n",
      "rest of your story.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I've no story, ma'am, to tell, but as how mammy says he must go to the\r\n",
      "fair Monday fortnight, to be sold, if she can't get the two guineas for\r\n",
      "her rent; and I should be main sorry to part with him, for I love him,\r\n",
      "and he loves me; so I'll work for him, I will, all I can.  To be sure, as\r\n",
      "mammy says, I have no chance, such a little fellow as I am, of earning\r\n",
      "two guineas afore Monday fortnight.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But are you willing earnestly to work?\" said the lady; \"you know there\r\n",
      "is a great deal of difference between picking up a few stones, and\r\n",
      "working steadily every day, and all day long.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But,\" said Jem, \"I would work every day, and all day long.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then,\" said the lady, \"I will give you work.  Come here, to-morrow\r\n",
      "morning, and my gardener will set you to weed the shrubberies, and I will\r\n",
      "pay you sixpence a day.  Remember, you must be at the gates by six\r\n",
      "o'clock.\"  Jem bowed, thanked her, and went away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was late in the evening, and Jem was impatient to get home to feed\r\n",
      "Lightfoot; yet he recollected that he had promised the man who had\r\n",
      "trusted him to sell the fossils, that he would bring him half of what he\r\n",
      "got for them; so he thought that he had better go to him directly; and\r\n",
      "away he went, running along by the waterside about a quarter of a mile,\r\n",
      "till he came to the man's house.  He was just come home from work, and\r\n",
      "was surprised when Jem showed him the half-crown, saying, \"Look what I\r\n",
      "got for the stones; you are to have half, you know.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" said the man, when he had heard his story, \"I shall not take half\r\n",
      "of that; it was given to you.  I expected but a shilling at the most, and\r\n",
      "the half of that is but sixpence, and that I'll take.  Wife, give the lad\r\n",
      "two shillings, and take this half-crown.\"  So the wife opened an old\r\n",
      "glove, and took out two shillings; and the man, as she opened the glove,\r\n",
      "put in his fingers, and took out a little silver penny.  \"There, he shall\r\n",
      "have that into the bargain for his honesty--honesty is the best policy--\r\n",
      "there's a lucky penny for you, that I've kept ever since I can remember.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't you ever go to part with it, do ye hear!\" cried the woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let him do what he will with it, wife,\" said the man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But,\" argued the wife, \"another penny would do just as well to buy\r\n",
      "gingerbread; and that's what it will go for.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, that it shall not, I promise you,\" said Jem; and so he ran away\r\n",
      "home, fed Lightfoot, stroked him, went to bed, jumped up at five o'clock\r\n",
      "in the morning, and went singing to work as gay as a lark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Four days he worked \"every day and all day long\"; and every evening the\r\n",
      "lady, when she came out to walk in her gardens, looked at his work.  At\r\n",
      "last she said to her gardener, \"This little boy works very hard.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never had so good a little boy about the grounds,\" said the gardener;\r\n",
      "\"he's always at his work, let me come by when I will, and he has got\r\n",
      "twice as much done as another would do; yes, twice as much, ma'am; for\r\n",
      "look here--he began at this 'ere rose-bush, and now he's got to where you\r\n",
      "stand, ma'am; and here is the day's work that t'other boy, and he's three\r\n",
      "years older too, did to-day--I say, measure Jem's fairly, and it's twice\r\n",
      "as much, I'm sure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the lady to her gardener, \"show me how much is a fair day's\r\n",
      "work for a boy of his age.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come at six o'clock and go at six? why, about this much, ma'am,\" said\r\n",
      "the gardener, marking off a piece of the border with his spade.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then, little boy,\" said the lady, \"so much shall be your task every day.\r\n",
      "The gardener will mark it off for you; and when you've done, the rest of\r\n",
      "the day you may do what you please.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem was extremely glad of this; and the next day he had finished his task\r\n",
      "by four o'clock; so that he had all the rest of the evening to himself.\r\n",
      "He was as fond of play as any little boy could be; and when he was at it\r\n",
      "he played with all the eagerness and gaiety imaginable; so as soon as he\r\n",
      "had finished his task, fed Lightfoot, and put by the sixpence he had\r\n",
      "earned that day, he ran to the playground in the village, where he found\r\n",
      "a party of boys playing, and amongst them Lazy Lawrence, who indeed was\r\n",
      "not playing, but lounging upon a gate, with his thumb in his mouth.  The\r\n",
      "rest were playing at cricket.  Jem joined them, and was the merriest and\r\n",
      "most active amongst them; till, at last, when quite out of breath with\r\n",
      "running, he was obliged to give up to rest himself, and sat down upon the\r\n",
      "stile, close to the gate on which Lazy Lawrence was swinging.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And why don't you play, Lawrence?\" said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm tired,\" said Lawrence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Tired of what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know well what tires me; grandmother says I'm ill, and I must\r\n",
      "take something--I don't know what ails me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, pugh! take a good race--one, two, three, and away--and you'll find\r\n",
      "yourself as well as ever.  Come, run--one, two, three, and away.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, no, I can't run, indeed,\" said he, hanging back heavily; \"you know I\r\n",
      "can play all day long if I like it, so I don't mind play as you do, who\r\n",
      "have only one hour for it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So much the worse for you.  Come, now, I'm quite fresh again, will you\r\n",
      "have one game at ball? do.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I tell you I can't; I'm as tired as if I had been working all day\r\n",
      "long as hard as a horse.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ten times more,\" said Jem, \"for I have been working all day long, as\r\n",
      "hard as a horse, and yet you see I'm not a bit tired, only a little out\r\n",
      "of breath just now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's very odd,\" said Lawrence, and yawned, for want of some better\r\n",
      "answer; then taking out a handful of halfpence,--\"See what I got from\r\n",
      "father today, because I asked him just at the right time, when he had\r\n",
      "drunk a glass or two; then I can get anything I want out of him--see! a\r\n",
      "penny, twopence, threepence, fourpence--there's eightpence in all; would\r\n",
      "not you be happy if you had EIGHTPENCE?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, I don't know,\" said Jem, laughing, \"for you don't seem happy, and\r\n",
      "you HAVE EIGHTPENCE.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That does not signify, though.  I'm sure you only say that because you\r\n",
      "envy me.  You don't know what it is to have eightpence.  You never had\r\n",
      "more than twopence or threepence at a time in all your life.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem smiled.  \"Oh, as to that,\" said he, \"you are mistaken, for I have at\r\n",
      "this very time more than twopence, threepence, or eightpence either.  I\r\n",
      "have--let me--see--stones, two shillings; then five days' work--that's\r\n",
      "five sixpences, that's two shillings and sixpence; in all, makes four\r\n",
      "shillings and sixpence; and my silver penny, is four and sevenpence--four\r\n",
      "and sevenpence!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You have not!\" said Lawrence, roused so as absolutely to stand upright,\r\n",
      "\"four and sevenpence, have you?  Show it me, and then I'll believe you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Follow me, then,\" cried Jem, \"and I'll soon make you believe me; come.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is it far?\" said Lawrence, following half-running, half-hobbling, till\r\n",
      "he came to the stable, where Jem showed him his treasure.  \"And how did\r\n",
      "you come by it--honestly?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Honestly! to be sure I did; I earned it all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lord bless me, earned it! well, I've a great mind to work; but then it's\r\n",
      "such hot weather, besides, grandmother says I'm not strong enough yet for\r\n",
      "hard work; and besides, I know how to coax daddy out of money when I want\r\n",
      "it, so I need not work.  But four and sevenpence; let's see, what will\r\n",
      "you do with it all?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's a secret,\" said Jem, looking great.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can guess; I know what I'd do with it if it was mine.  First, I'd buy\r\n",
      "pocketfuls of gingerbread; then I'd buy ever so many apples and nuts.\r\n",
      "Don't you love nuts?  I'd buy nuts enough to last me from this time to\r\n",
      "Christmas, and I'd make little Newton crack 'em for me, for that's the\r\n",
      "worst of nuts; there's the trouble of cracking 'em.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, you never deserve to have a nut.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But you'll give me some of yours,\" said Lawrence, in a fawning tone; for\r\n",
      "he thought it easier to coax than to work--\"you'll give me some of your\r\n",
      "good things, won't you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall not have any of those good things,\" said Jem.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then, what will you do with all your money?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I know very well what to do with it; but, as I told you, that's a\r\n",
      "secret, and I sha'n't tell it anybody.  Come now, let's go back and play-\r\n",
      "-their game's up, I daresay.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lawrence went back with him, full of curiosity, and out of humour with\r\n",
      "himself and his eightpence.  \"If I had four and sevenpence,\" said he to\r\n",
      "himself, \"I certainly should be happy!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next day, as usual, Jem jumped up before six o'clock and went to his\r\n",
      "work, whilst Lazy Lawrence sauntered about without knowing what to do\r\n",
      "with himself.  In the course of two days he laid out sixpence of his\r\n",
      "money in apples and gingerbread; and as long as these lasted, he found\r\n",
      "himself well received by his companions; but, at length the third day he\r\n",
      "spent his last halfpenny, and when it was gone, unfortunately some nuts\r\n",
      "tempted him very much, but he had no money to pay for them; so he ran\r\n",
      "home to coax his father, as he called it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he got home he heard his father talking very loud, and at first he\r\n",
      "thought he was drunk; but when he opened the kitchen door, he saw that he\r\n",
      "was not drunk, but angry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You lazy dog!\" cried he, turning suddenly upon Lawrence, and gave him\r\n",
      "such a violent box on the ear as made the light flash from his eyes; \"you\r\n",
      "lazy dog!  See what you've done for me--look!--look, look, I say!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lawrence looked as soon as he came to the use of his senses, and with\r\n",
      "fear, amazement and remorse, beheld at least a dozen bottles burst, and\r\n",
      "the fine Worcestershire cider streaming over the floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now, did not I order you three days ago to carry these bottles to the\r\n",
      "cellar, and did not I charge you to wire the corks? answer me, you lazy\r\n",
      "rascal; did not I?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Lawrence, scratching his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And why was not it done, I ask you?\" cried his father, with renewed\r\n",
      "anger, as another bottle burst at the moment.  \"What do you stand there\r\n",
      "for, you lazy brat? why don't you move, I say?  No, no,\" catching hold of\r\n",
      "him, \"I believe you can't move; but I'll make you.\"  And he shook him\r\n",
      "till Lawrence was so giddy he could not stand.  \"What had you to think\r\n",
      "of?  What had you to do all day long that you could not carry my cider,\r\n",
      "my Worcestershire cider, to the cellar when I bid you?  But go, you'll\r\n",
      "never be good for anything; you are such a lazy rascal--get out of my\r\n",
      "sight!\"  So saying, he pushed him out of the house door, and Lawrence\r\n",
      "sneaked off, seeing that this was no time to make his petition for\r\n",
      "halfpence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next day he saw the nuts again, and wishing for them more than ever,\r\n",
      "he went home, in hopes that his father, as he said to himself, would be\r\n",
      "in a better humour.  But the cider was still fresh in his recollection;\r\n",
      "and the moment Lawrence began to whisper the word \"halfpenny\" in his ear,\r\n",
      "his father swore, with a loud oath, \"I will not give you a halfpenny, no,\r\n",
      "not a farthing, for a month to come.  If you want money, go work for it;\r\n",
      "I've had enough of your laziness--go work!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At these terrible words Lawrence burst into tears, and, going to the side\r\n",
      "of a ditch, sat down and cried for an hour; and when he had cried till he\r\n",
      "could cry no more, he exerted himself so far as to empty his pockets, to\r\n",
      "see whether there might not happen to be one halfpenny left; and, to his\r\n",
      "great joy, in the farthest corner of his pocket one halfpenny was found.\r\n",
      "With this he proceeded to the fruit woman's stall.  She was busy weighing\r\n",
      "out some plums, so he was obliged to wait; and whilst he was waiting he\r\n",
      "heard some people near him talking and laughing very loud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fruit woman's stall was at the gate of an inn yard; and peeping\r\n",
      "through the gate in this yard, Lawrence saw a postilion and a stable boy,\r\n",
      "about his own size, playing at pitch farthing.  He stood by watching them\r\n",
      "for a few minutes.  \"I began but with one halfpenny,\" cried the stable\r\n",
      "boy, with an oath, \"and now I've got twopence!\" added he, jingling the\r\n",
      "halfpence in his waistcoat pocket.  Lawrence was moved at the sound, and\r\n",
      "said to himself, \"If _I_ begin with one halfpenny I may end, like him,\r\n",
      "with having twopence; and it is easier to play at pitch farthing than to\r\n",
      "work.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So he stepped forward, presenting his halfpenny, offering to toss up with\r\n",
      "the stable boy, who, after looking him full in the face, accepted the\r\n",
      "proposal, and threw his halfpenny into the air.  \"Head or tail?\" cried\r\n",
      "he.  \"Head,\" replied Lawrence, and it came up head.  He seized the penny,\r\n",
      "surprised at his own success, and would have gone instantly to have laid\r\n",
      "it out in nuts; but the stable boy stopped him, and tempted him to throw\r\n",
      "again.  This time Lawrence lost; he threw again and won; and so he went\r\n",
      "on, sometimes losing, but most frequently winning, till half the morning\r\n",
      "was lost.  At last, however, finding himself the master of three\r\n",
      "halfpence, said he would play no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The stable boy, grumbling, swore he would have his revenge another time,\r\n",
      "and Lawrence went and bought his nuts.  \"It is a good thing,\" said he to\r\n",
      "himself, \"to play at pitch farthing; the next time I want a halfpenny\r\n",
      "I'll not ask my father for it, nor go to work neither.\"  Satisfied with\r\n",
      "this resolution, he sat down to crack his nuts at his leisure, upon the\r\n",
      "horse block in the inn yard.  Here, whilst he ate, he overheard the\r\n",
      "conversation of the stable boys and postilions.  At first their shocking\r\n",
      "oaths and loud wrangling frightened and shocked him; for Lawrence, though\r\n",
      "lazy, had not yet learned to be a wicked boy.  But, by degrees, he was\r\n",
      "accustomed to the swearing and quarrelling, and took a delight and\r\n",
      "interest in their disputes and battles.  As this was an amusement which\r\n",
      "he could enjoy without any sort of exertion, he soon grew so fond of it,\r\n",
      "that every day he returned to the stable yard, and the horse block became\r\n",
      "his constant seat.  Here he found some relief from the insupportable\r\n",
      "fatigue of doing nothing, and here, hour after hour, with his elbows on\r\n",
      "his knees, and his head on his hands, he sat, the spectator of\r\n",
      "wickedness.  Gaming, cheating and lying soon became familiar to him; and,\r\n",
      "to complete his ruin, he formed a sudden and close intimacy with the\r\n",
      "stable boy (a very bad boy) with whom he had first begun to game.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The consequences of this intimacy we shall presently see.  But it is now\r\n",
      "time to inquire what little Jem had been doing all this while.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day, after Jem had finished his task, the gardener asked him to stay\r\n",
      "a little while, to help him to carry some geranium pots into the hall.\r\n",
      "Jem, always active and obliging, readily stayed from play, and was\r\n",
      "carrying in a heavy flower pot, when his mistress crossed the hall.\r\n",
      "\"What a terrible litter!\" said she, \"you are making here--why don't you\r\n",
      "wipe your shoes upon the mat?\"  Jem turned to look for the mat, but he\r\n",
      "saw none.  \"Oh,\" said the lady recollecting herself, \"I can't blame you,\r\n",
      "for there is no mat.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, ma'am,\" said the gardener, \"nor I don't know when, if ever, the man\r\n",
      "will bring home those mats you bespoke, ma'am.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am very sorry to hear that,\" said the lady; \"I wish we could find\r\n",
      "somebody who would do them, if he can't.  I should not care what sort of\r\n",
      "mats they were, so that one could wipe one's feet on them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem, as he was sweeping away the litter, when he heard these last words,\r\n",
      "said to himself, \"Perhaps I could make a mat.\"  And all the way home, as\r\n",
      "he trudged along whistling, he was thinking over a scheme for making\r\n",
      "mats, which, however bold it may appear, he did not despair of executing,\r\n",
      "with patience and industry.  Many were the difficulties which his\r\n",
      "\"prophetic eye\" foresaw; but he felt within himself that spirit which\r\n",
      "spurs men on to great enterprises, and makes them \"trample on\r\n",
      "impossibilities.\"  In the first place, he recollected that he had seen\r\n",
      "Lazy Lawrence, whilst he lounged upon the gate, twist a bit of heath into\r\n",
      "different shapes; and he thought, that if he could find some way of\r\n",
      "plaiting heath firmly together, it would make a very pretty green soft\r\n",
      "mat, which would do very well for one to wipe one's shoes on.  About a\r\n",
      "mile from his mother's house, on the common which Jem rode over when he\r\n",
      "went to Farmer Truck's for the giant strawberries, he remembered to have\r\n",
      "seen a great quantity of this heath; and, as it was now only six o'clock\r\n",
      "in the evening, he knew that he should have time to feed Lightfoot,\r\n",
      "stroke him, go to the common, return, and make one trial of his skill\r\n",
      "before he went to bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lightfoot carried him swiftly to the common, and there Jem gathered as\r\n",
      "much of the heath as he thought he should want.  But what toil! what\r\n",
      "time! what pains did it cost him, before he could make anything like a\r\n",
      "mat!  Twenty times he was ready to throw aside the heath, and give up his\r\n",
      "project, from impatience of repeated disappointments.  But still he\r\n",
      "persevered.  Nothing TRULY GREAT can be accomplished without toil and\r\n",
      "time.  Two hours he worked before he went to bed.  All his play hours the\r\n",
      "next day he spent at his mat; which, in all, made five hours of fruitless\r\n",
      "attempts.  The sixth, however, repaid him for the labours of the other\r\n",
      "five.  He conquered his grand difficulty of fastening the heath\r\n",
      "substantially together, and at length completely finished a mat, which\r\n",
      "far surpassed his most sanguine expectations.  He was extremely happy--\r\n",
      "sang, danced round it--whistled--looked at it again and again, and could\r\n",
      "hardly leave off looking at it when it was time to go to bed.  He laid it\r\n",
      "by his bedside, that he might see it the moment he awoke in the morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now came the grand pleasure of carrying it to his mistress.  She\r\n",
      "looked fully as much surprised as he expected, when she saw it, and when\r\n",
      "she heard who made it.  After having duly admired it, she asked how much\r\n",
      "he expected for his mat.  \"Expect!--Nothing, ma'am,\" said Jem; \"I meant\r\n",
      "to give it you, if you'd have it; I did not mean to sell it.  I made it\r\n",
      "in my play hours, I was very happy in making it; and I'm very glad, too,\r\n",
      "that you like it; and if you please to keep it, ma'am, that's all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But that's not all,\" said the lady.  \"Spend your time no more in weeding\r\n",
      "in my garden, you can employ yourself much better; you shall have the\r\n",
      "reward of your ingenuity as well as of your industry.  Make as many more\r\n",
      "such mats as you can, and I will take care and dispose of them for you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank'e, ma'am,\" said Jem, making his best bow, for he thought by the\r\n",
      "lady's looks that she meant to do him a favour, though he repeated to\r\n",
      "himself, \"Dispose of them, what does that mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next day he went to work to make more mats, and he soon learned to\r\n",
      "make them so well and quickly, that he was surprised at his own success.\r\n",
      "In every one he made he found less difficulty, so that, instead of making\r\n",
      "two, he could soon make four in a day.  In a fortnight he made eighteen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was Saturday night when he finished, and he carried, at three\r\n",
      "journeys, his eighteen mats to his mistress' house; piled them all up in\r\n",
      "the hall, and stood with his hat off, with a look of proud humility,\r\n",
      "beside the pile, waiting for his mistress' appearance.  Presently a\r\n",
      "folding-door, at one end of the hall, opened, and he saw his mistress,\r\n",
      "with a great many gentlemen and ladies, rising from several tables.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! there is my little boy and his mats,\" cried the lady; and, followed\r\n",
      "by all the rest of the company, she came into the hall.  Jem modestly\r\n",
      "retired whilst they looked at his mats; but in a minute or two his\r\n",
      "mistress beckoned to him, and when he came into the middle of the circle,\r\n",
      "he saw that his pile of mats had disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the lady, smiling, \"what do you see that makes you look so\r\n",
      "surprised?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That all my mats are gone,\" said Jem; \"but you are very welcome.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are we?\" said the lady, \"well, take up your hat and go home then, for\r\n",
      "you see that it is getting late, and you know Lightfoot will wonder\r\n",
      "what's become of you.\"  Jem turned round to take up his hat, which he had\r\n",
      "left on the floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But how his countenance changed! the hat was heavy with shillings.\r\n",
      "Everyone who had taken a mat had put in two shillings; so that for the\r\n",
      "eighteen mats he had got thirty-six shillings.  \"Thirty-six shillings,\"\r\n",
      "said the lady; \"five and sevenpence I think you told me you had earned\r\n",
      "already--how much does that make?  I must add, I believe, one other\r\n",
      "sixpence to make out your two guineas.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Two guineas!\" exclaimed Jem, now quite conquering his bashfulness, for\r\n",
      "at the moment he forgot where he was, and saw nobody that was by.  \"Two\r\n",
      "guineas!\" cried he, clapping his hands together,--\"O, Lightfoot!  O,\r\n",
      "mother!\"  Then, recollecting himself, he saw his mistress, whom he now\r\n",
      "looked up to quite as a friend.  \"Will YOU thank them all?\" said he,\r\n",
      "scarcely daring to glance his eyes round upon the company; \"will YOU\r\n",
      "thank 'em, for you know I don't know how to thank 'em RIGHTLY.\"\r\n",
      "Everybody thought, however, that they had been thanked RIGHTLY.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now we won't keep you any longer, only,\" said his mistress, \"I have one\r\n",
      "thing to ask you, that I may be by when you show your treasure to your\r\n",
      "mother.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come, then,\" said Jem, \"come with me now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not now,\" said the lady, laughing; \"but I will come to Ashton to-morrow\r\n",
      "evening; perhaps your mother can find me a few strawberries.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That she will,\" said Jem:  \"I'll search the garden myself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He now went home, but felt it a great restraint to wait till to-morrow\r\n",
      "evening before he told his mother.  To console himself he flew to the\r\n",
      "stable:--\"Lightfoot, you're not to be sold on Monday, poor fellow!\" said\r\n",
      "he, patting him, and then could not refrain from counting out his money.\r\n",
      "Whilst he was intent upon this, Jem was startled by a noise at the door:\r\n",
      "somebody was trying to pull up the latch.  It opened, and there came in\r\n",
      "Lazy Lawrence, with a boy in a red jacket, who had a cock under his arm.\r\n",
      "They started when they got into the middle of the stable, and when they\r\n",
      "saw Jem, who had been at first hidden by the horse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We--we--we came,\" stammered Lazy Lawrence--\"I mean, I came to--to--to--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To ask you,\" continued the stable-boy, in a bold tone, \"whether you will\r\n",
      "go with us to the cock-fight on Monday?  See, I've a fine cock here, and\r\n",
      "Lawrence told me you were a great friend of his; so I came.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lawrence now attempted to say something in praise of the pleasures of\r\n",
      "cock-fighting and in recommendation of his new companion.  But Jem looked\r\n",
      "at the stable-boy with dislike, and a sort of dread.  Then turning his\r\n",
      "eyes upon the cock with a look of compassion, said, in a low voice, to\r\n",
      "Lawrence, \"Shall you like to stand by and see its eyes pecked out?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Lawrence, \"as to that; but they say a cockfight's a\r\n",
      "fine sight, and it's no more cruel in me to go than another; and a great\r\n",
      "many go, and I've nothing else to do, so I shall go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I have something else to do,\" said Jem, laughing, \"so I shall not\r\n",
      "go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But,\" continued Lawrence, \"you know Monday is the great Bristol fair,\r\n",
      "and one must be merry then, of all the days in the year.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"One day in the year, sure, there's no harm in being merry,\" said the\r\n",
      "stable boy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I hope not,\" said Jem; \"for I know for my part, I am merry every day in\r\n",
      "the year.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's very odd,\" said Lawrence; \"but I know for my part, I would not\r\n",
      "for all the world miss going to the fair, for at least it will be\r\n",
      "something to talk of for half a year after.  Come, you'll go, won't you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" said Jem, still looking as if he did not like to talk before the\r\n",
      "ill-looking stranger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then what will you do with all your money?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll tell you about that another time,\" whispered Jem; \"and don't you go\r\n",
      "to see that cock's eyes pecked out; it won't make you merry, I'm sure.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If I had anything else to divert me,\" said Lawrence, hesitating and\r\n",
      "yawning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come,\" cried the stable boy, seizing his stretching arm, \"come along,\"\r\n",
      "cried he; and, pulling him away from Jem, upon whom he cast a look of\r\n",
      "extreme contempt; \"leave him alone, he's not the sort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What a fool you are,\" said he to Lawrence, the moment he got him out of\r\n",
      "the stable; \"you might have known he would not go, else we should soon\r\n",
      "have trimmed him out of his four and sevenpence.  But how came you to\r\n",
      "talk of four and sevenpence.  I saw in the manger a hat full of silver.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" exclaimed Lawrence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed; but why did you stammer so when we first got in?  You had\r\n",
      "liked to have blown us all up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I was so ashamed,\" said Lawrence, hanging down his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ashamed! but you must not talk of shame now you are in for it, and I\r\n",
      "sha'n't let you off; you owe us half a crown, recollect, and I must be\r\n",
      "paid to-night, so see and get the money somehow or other.\"  After a\r\n",
      "considerable pause he added, \"I answer for it he'd never miss half a\r\n",
      "crown out of all that silver.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But to steal,\" said Lawrence, drawing back with horror, \"I never thought\r\n",
      "I should come to that--and from poor Jem, too--the money that he has\r\n",
      "worked so hard for, too.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But it is not stealing; we don't mean to steal; only to borrow it; and\r\n",
      "if we win, which we certainly shall, at the cock-fight, pay it back\r\n",
      "again, and he'll never know anything about the matter, and what harm will\r\n",
      "it do him?  Besides, what signifies talking, you can't go to the cock-\r\n",
      "fight, or the fair either, if you don't; and I tell ye we don't mean to\r\n",
      "steal it; we'll pay it by Monday night.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lawrence made no reply, and they parted without his coming to any\r\n",
      "determination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here let us pause in our story.  We are almost afraid to go on.  The rest\r\n",
      "is very shocking.  Our little readers will shudder as they read.  But it\r\n",
      "is better that they should know the truth, and see what the idle boy came\r\n",
      "to at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the dead of the night, Lawrence heard somebody tap at his window.  He\r\n",
      "knew well who it was, for this was the signal agreed upon between him and\r\n",
      "his wicked companion.  He trembled at the thoughts of what he was about\r\n",
      "to do, and lay quite still, with his head under the bedclothes, till he\r\n",
      "heard the second tap.  Then he got up, dressed himself, and opened his\r\n",
      "window.  It was almost even with the ground.  His companion said to him,\r\n",
      "in a hollow voice, \"Are you ready?\"  He made no answer, but got out of\r\n",
      "the window and followed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he got to the stable a black cloud was just passing over the moon,\r\n",
      "and it was quite dark.  \"Where are you?\" whispered Lawrence, groping\r\n",
      "about, \"where are you?  Speak to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am here; give me your hand.\"  Lawrence stretched out his hand.  \"Is\r\n",
      "that your hand?\" said the wicked boy, as Lawrence laid hold of him; \"how\r\n",
      "cold it feels.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let us go back,\" said Lawrence; \"it is time yet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is no time to go back,\" replied the other, opening the door; \"you've\r\n",
      "gone too far now to go back,\" and he pushed Lawrence into the stable.\r\n",
      "\"Have you found it?  Take care of the horse.  Have you done?  What are\r\n",
      "you about?  Make haste, I hear a noise,\" said the stable boy, who watched\r\n",
      "at the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am feeling for the half-crown, but I can't find it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bring all together.\"  He brought Jem's broken flower pot, with all the\r\n",
      "money in it, to the door.  The black cloud had now passed over the moon,\r\n",
      "and the light shone full upon them.  \"What do we stand here for?\" said\r\n",
      "the stable boy, snatching the flower-pot out of Lawrence's trembling\r\n",
      "hands, and pulled him away from the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good God!\" cried Lawrence, \"you won't take all.  You said you'd only\r\n",
      "take half a crown, and pay it back on Monday.  You said you'd only take\r\n",
      "half a crown!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hold your tongue,\" replied the other, walking on, deaf to all\r\n",
      "remonstrances--\"if ever I am to be hanged, it sha'n't be for half a\r\n",
      "crown.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lawrence's blood ran cold in his veins, and he felt as if all his hair\r\n",
      "stood on end.  Not another word passed.  His accomplice carried off the\r\n",
      "money, and Lawrence crept, with all the horrors of guilt upon him, to his\r\n",
      "restless bed.  All night he was starting from frightful dreams; or else,\r\n",
      "broad awake, he lay listening to every small noise, unable to stir, and\r\n",
      "scarcely daring to breathe--tormented by that most dreadful of all kinds\r\n",
      "of fear, that fear which is the constant companion of an evil conscience.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He thought the morning would never come; but when it was day, when he\r\n",
      "heard the birds sing, and saw everything look cheerful as usual, he felt\r\n",
      "still more miserable.  It was Sunday morning, and the bell rang for\r\n",
      "church.  All the children of the village, dressed in their Sunday\r\n",
      "clothes, innocent and gay, and little Jem, the best and gayest amongst\r\n",
      "them, went flocking by his door to church.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Lawrence,\" said Jem, pulling his coat as he passed and saw\r\n",
      "Lawrence leaning against his father's door, \"what makes you look so\r\n",
      "black?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I?\" said Lawrence, starting; \"why do you say that I look black?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nay, then,\" said Jem, \"you look white enough now, if that will please\r\n",
      "you, for you're turned as pale as death.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pale?\" replied Lawrence, not knowing what he said, and turned abruptly\r\n",
      "away, for he dared not stand another look of Jem's; conscious that guilt\r\n",
      "was written in his face, he shunned every eye.  He would now have given\r\n",
      "the world to have thrown off the load of guilt which lay upon his mind.\r\n",
      "He longed to follow Jem, to fall upon his knees and confess all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dreading the moment when Jem should discover his loss, Lawrence dared not\r\n",
      "stay at home, and not knowing what to do, or where to go, he mechanically\r\n",
      "went to his old haunt at the stable yard, and lurked thereabouts all day\r\n",
      "with his accomplice, who tried in vain to quiet his fears and raise his\r\n",
      "spirits by talking of the next day's cock-fight.  It was agreed that as\r\n",
      "soon as the dusk of the evening came on, they should go together into a\r\n",
      "certain lonely field, and there divide their booty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the meantime, Jem, when he returned from church, was very full of\r\n",
      "business, preparing for the reception of his mistress, of whose intended\r\n",
      "visit he had informed his mother; and whilst she was arranging the\r\n",
      "kitchen and their little parlour, he ran to search the strawberry beds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, my Jem, how merry you are to-day!\" said his mother, when he came in\r\n",
      "with the strawberries, and was jumping about the room playfully.  \"Now,\r\n",
      "keep those spirits of yours, Jem, till you want 'em, and don't let it\r\n",
      "come upon you all at once.  Have it in mind that to-morrow's fair day,\r\n",
      "and Lightfoot must go.  I bid Farmer Truck call for him to-night.  He\r\n",
      "said he'd take him along with his own, and he'll be here just now--and\r\n",
      "then I know how it will be with you, Jem!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So do I!\" cried Jem, swallowing his secret with great difficulty, and\r\n",
      "then tumbling head over heels four times running.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A carriage passed the window, and stopped at the door.  Jem ran out; it\r\n",
      "was his mistress.  She came in smiling, and soon made the old woman\r\n",
      "smile, too, by praising the neatness of everything in the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We shall pass over, however important as they were deemed at the time,\r\n",
      "the praises of the strawberries, and of \"my grandmother's china plate.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another knock was heard at the door.  \"Run, Jem,\" said his mother.  \"I\r\n",
      "hope it's our milk-woman with cream for the lady.\"  No; it was Farmer\r\n",
      "Truck come for Lightfoot.  The old woman's countenance fell.  \"Fetch him\r\n",
      "out, dear,\" said she, turning to her son; but Jem was gone; he flew out\r\n",
      "to the stable the moment he saw the flap of Farmer Truck's great-coat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sit ye down, farmer,\" said the old woman, after they had waited about\r\n",
      "five minutes in expectation of Jem's return.  \"You'd best sit down, if\r\n",
      "the lady will give you leave; for he'll not hurry himself back again.  My\r\n",
      "boy's a fool, madam, about that there horse.\"  Trying to laugh, she\r\n",
      "added, \"I knew how Lightfoot and he would be loath enough to part.  He\r\n",
      "won't bring him out till the last minute; so do sit ye down, neighbour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The farmer had scarcely sat down when Jem, with a pale, wild countenance\r\n",
      "came back.  \"What's the matter?\" said his mistress.  \"God bless the boy!\"\r\n",
      "said his mother, looking at him quite frightened, whilst he tried to\r\n",
      "speak, but could not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She went up to him, and then leaning his head against her, he cried,\r\n",
      "\"It's gone!--it's all gone!\" and, bursting into tears, he sobbed as if\r\n",
      "his little heart would break.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's gone, love?\" said his mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My two guineas--Lightfoot's two guineas.  I went to fetch 'em to give\r\n",
      "you, mammy; but the broken flower-pot that I put them in, and all's\r\n",
      "gone!--quite gone!\" repeated he, checking his sobs.  \"I saw them safe\r\n",
      "last night, and was showing 'em to Lightfoot; and I was so glad to think\r\n",
      "I had earned them all myself; and I thought how surprised you'd look, and\r\n",
      "how glad you'd be, and how you'd kiss me, and all!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His mother listened to him with the greatest surprise, whilst his\r\n",
      "mistress stood in silence, looking first at the old woman, and then at\r\n",
      "Jem with a penetrating eye, as if she suspected the truth of his story,\r\n",
      "and was afraid of becoming the dupe of her own compassion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This is a very strange thing!\" said she, gravely.  \"How came you to\r\n",
      "leave all your money in a broken flower-pot in the stable?  How came you\r\n",
      "not to give it to your mother to take care of?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, don't you remember?\" said Jem, looking up, in the midst of his\r\n",
      "tears--\"why, don't you remember you, your own self, bid me not tell her\r\n",
      "about it till you were by?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And did you not tell her?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nay, ask mammy,\" said Jem, a little offended; and when afterwards the\r\n",
      "lady went on questioning him in a severe manner, as if she did not\r\n",
      "believe him, he at last made no answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, Jem! Jem! why don't you speak to the lady?\" said his mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have spoke, and spoke the truth,\" said Jem, proudly; \"and she did not\r\n",
      "believe me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still the lady, who had lived too long in the world to be without\r\n",
      "suspicion, maintained a cold manner, and determined to wait the event\r\n",
      "without interfering, saying only, that she hoped the money would be\r\n",
      "found, and advised Jem to have done crying.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have done,\" said Jem; \"I shall cry no more.\"  And as he had the\r\n",
      "greatest command over himself, he actually did not shed another tear, not\r\n",
      "even when the farmer got up to go, saying, he could wait no longer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jem silently went to bring out Lightfoot.  The lady now took her seat,\r\n",
      "where she could see all that passed at the open parlour-window.  The old\r\n",
      "woman stood at the door, and several idle people of the village, who had\r\n",
      "gathered round the lady's carriage examining it, turned about to listen.\r\n",
      "In a minute or two Jem appeared, with a steady countenance, leading\r\n",
      "Lightfoot and, when he came up, without saying a word, put the bridle\r\n",
      "into Farmer Truck's hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He HAS BEEN a good horse,\" said the farmer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He IS a good horse!\" cried Jem, and threw his arm over Lightfoot's neck,\r\n",
      "hiding his own face as he leaned upon him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this instant a party of milk-women went by; and one of them, having\r\n",
      "set down her pail, came behind Jem, and gave him a pretty smart blow upon\r\n",
      "the back.  He looked up.  \"And don't you know me?\" said she.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I forget,\" said Jem; \"I think I have seen your face before, but I\r\n",
      "forget.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you so? and you'll tell me just now,\" said she, half opening her\r\n",
      "hand, \"that you forget who gave you this, and who charged you not to part\r\n",
      "with it, too.\"  Here she quite opened her large hand, and on the palm of\r\n",
      "it appeared Jem's silver penny.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where?\" exclaimed Jem, seizing it, \"oh, where did you find it? and have\r\n",
      "you--oh, tell me, have you got the rest of my money?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I know nothing of your money--I don't know what you would be at,\" said\r\n",
      "the milk-woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But where--pray tell me where--did you find this?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With them that you gave it to, I suppose,\" said the milk-woman, turning\r\n",
      "away suddenly to take up her milk-pail.  But now Jem's mistress called to\r\n",
      "her through the window, begging her to stop, and joining in his\r\n",
      "entreaties to know how she came by the silver penny.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, madam,\" said she, taking up the corner of her apron, \"I came by it\r\n",
      "in an odd way, too.  You must know my Betty is sick, so I came with the\r\n",
      "milk myself, though it's not what I'm used to; for my Betty--you know my\r\n",
      "Betty?\" said she, turning round to the old woman, \"my Betty serves you,\r\n",
      "and she's a tight and stirring lassy, ma'am, I can assure--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I don't doubt it,\" said the lady, impatiently; \"but about the\r\n",
      "silver penny?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, that's true; as I was coming along all alone, for the rest came\r\n",
      "round, and I came a short cut across yon field--no, you can't see it,\r\n",
      "madam, where you stand--but if you were here--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see it--I know it,\" said Jem, out of breath with anxiety.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well--well--I rested my pail upon the stile, and sets me down awhile,\r\n",
      "and there comes out of the hedge--I don't know well how, for they\r\n",
      "startled me so I'd liked to have thrown down my milk--two boys, one about\r\n",
      "the size of he,\" said she pointing to Jem, \"and one a matter taller, but\r\n",
      "ill-looking like; so I did not think to stir to make way for them, and\r\n",
      "they were like in a desperate hurry:  so, without waiting for the stile,\r\n",
      "one of 'em pulled at the gate, and when it would not open (for it was\r\n",
      "tied with a pretty stout cord) one of 'em whips out with his knife and\r\n",
      "cuts it--  Now, have you a knife about you, sir?\" continued the milk\r\n",
      "woman to the farmer.  He gave her his knife.  \"Here, now, ma'am, just\r\n",
      "sticking, as it were here, between the blade and the haft, was the silver\r\n",
      "penny.  The lad took no notice; but when he opened it, out it falls.\r\n",
      "Still he takes no heed, but cuts the cord, as I said before, and through\r\n",
      "the gate they went, and out of sight in half a minute.  I picks up the\r\n",
      "penny, for my heart misgave me that it was the very one husband had had a\r\n",
      "long time, and had given against my voice to he,\" pointing to Jem; \"and I\r\n",
      "charged him not to part with it; and, ma'am, when I looked I knew it by\r\n",
      "the mark, so I thought I would show it to HE,\" again pointing to Jem,\r\n",
      "\"and let him give it back to those it belongs to.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It belongs to me,\" said Jem, \"I never gave it to anybody--but--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But,\" cried the farmer, \"those boys have robbed him; it is they who have\r\n",
      "all his money.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, which way did they go?\" cried Jem, \"I'll run after them.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, no,\" said the lady, calling to her servant; and she desired him to\r\n",
      "take his horse and ride after them.  \"Ay,\" added Farmer Truck, \"do you\r\n",
      "take the road, and I'll take the field way, and I'll be bound we'll have\r\n",
      "'em presently.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whilst they were gone in pursuit of the thieves, the lady, who was now\r\n",
      "thoroughly convinced of Jem's truth, desired her coachman would produce\r\n",
      "what she had ordered him to bring with him that evening.  Out of the boot\r\n",
      "of the carriage the coachman immediately produced a new saddle and\r\n",
      "bridle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How Jem's eyes sparkled when the saddle was thrown upon Lightfoot's back!\r\n",
      "\"Put it on your horse yourself, Jem,\" said the lady; \"it is yours.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Confused reports of Lightfoot's splendid accoutrements, of the pursuit of\r\n",
      "thieves, and of the fine and generous lady who was standing at Dame\r\n",
      "Preston's window, quickly spread through the village, and drew everybody\r\n",
      "from their houses.  They crowded round Jem to hear the story.  The\r\n",
      "children especially, who were fond of him, expressed the strongest\r\n",
      "indignation against the thieves.  Every eye was on the stretch; and now\r\n",
      "some, who had run down the lane, came back shouting, \"Here they are!\r\n",
      "they've got the thieves!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The footman on horseback carried one boy before him; and the farmer,\r\n",
      "striding along, dragged another.  The latter had on a red jacket, which\r\n",
      "little Jem immediately recollected, and scarcely dared lift his eyes to\r\n",
      "look at the boy on horseback.  \"Good God!\" said he to himself, \"it must\r\n",
      "be--yet surely it can't be Lawrence!\"  The footman rode on as fast as the\r\n",
      "people would let him.  The boy's hat was slouched, and his head hung\r\n",
      "down, so that nobody could see his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this instant there was a disturbance in the crowd.  A man who was half\r\n",
      "drunk pushed his way forwards, swearing that nobody should stop him; that\r\n",
      "he had a right to see--and he WOULD see.  And so he did; for, forcing\r\n",
      "through all resistance, he staggered up to the footman just as he was\r\n",
      "lifting down the boy he had carried before him.  \"I WILL--I tell you I\r\n",
      "WILL see the thief!\" cried the drunken man, pushing up the boy's hat.  It\r\n",
      "was his own son.  \"Lawrence!\" exclaimed the wretched father.  The shock\r\n",
      "sobered him at once, and he hid his face in his hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was an awful silence.  Lawrence fell on his knees, and in a voice\r\n",
      "that could scarcely be heard made a full confession of all the\r\n",
      "circumstances of his guilt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Such a young creature so wicked!\" the bystanders exclaimed; \"what could\r\n",
      "put such wickedness in your head?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bad company,\" said Lawrence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And how came you--what brought you into bad company?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know, except it was idleness.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While this was saying the farmer was emptying Lazy Lawrence's pockets;\r\n",
      "and when the money appeared, all his former companions in the village\r\n",
      "looked at each other with astonishment and terror.  Their parents grasped\r\n",
      "their little hands closer, and cried, \"Thank God! he is not my son.  How\r\n",
      "often when he was little we used, as he lounged about, to tell him that\r\n",
      "idleness was the root of all evil.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the hardened wretch, his accomplice, everyone was impatient to\r\n",
      "have him sent to gaol.  He put on a bold, insolent countenance, till he\r\n",
      "heard Lawrence's confession; till the money was found upon him; and he\r\n",
      "heard the milk-woman declare that she would swear to the silver penny\r\n",
      "which he had dropped.  Then he turned pale, and betrayed the strongest\r\n",
      "signs of fear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We must take him before the justice,\" said the farmer, \"and he'll be\r\n",
      "lodged in Bristol gaol.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Jem, springing forwards when Lawrence's hands were going to be\r\n",
      "tied, \"let him go--won't you?--can't you let him go?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, madam, for mercy's sake,\" said Jem's mother to the lady, \"think\r\n",
      "what a disgrace to his family to be sent to gaol.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His father stood by wringing his hands in an agony of despair.  \"It's all\r\n",
      "my fault,\" cried he; \"I brought him up in idleness.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But he'll never be idle any more,\" said Jem; \"won't you speak for him,\r\n",
      "ma'am?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't ask the lady to speak for him,\" said the farmer; \"it's better he\r\n",
      "should go to Bridewell now, than to the gallows by-and-by.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing more was said; for everybody felt the truth of the farmer's\r\n",
      "speech.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lawrence was eventually sent to Bridewell for a month, and the stable-boy\r\n",
      "was sent for trial, convicted, and transported to Botany Bay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During Lawrence's confinement, Jem often visited him, and carried him\r\n",
      "such little presents as he could afford to give; and Jem could afford to\r\n",
      "be GENEROUS, because he was INDUSTRIOUS.  Lawrence's heart was touched by\r\n",
      "his kindness, and his example struck him so forcibly that, when his\r\n",
      "confinement was ended, he resolved to set immediately to work; and, to\r\n",
      "the astonishment of all who knew him, soon became remarkable for\r\n",
      "industry.  He was found early and late at his work, established a new\r\n",
      "character, and for ever lost the name of \"Lazy Lawrence.\"\r\n",

      "Mr. Spencer, a very benevolent and sensible man, undertook the education\r\n",
      "of several poor children.  Among the rest was a boy of the name of\r\n",
      "Franklin, whom he had bred up from the time he was five years old.\r\n",
      "Franklin had the misfortune to be the son of a man of infamous character;\r\n",
      "and for many years this was a disgrace and reproach to his child.  When\r\n",
      "any of the neighbours' children quarrelled with him, they used to tell\r\n",
      "him that he would turn out like his father.  But Mr. Spencer always\r\n",
      "assured him that he might make himself whatever he pleased; that by\r\n",
      "behaving well he would certainly, sooner or later, secure the esteem and\r\n",

      "against him on his father's account.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"You are now going to leave me, and to begin the world for yourself.  You\r\n",
      "will carry this letter to my sister, Mrs. Churchill, in Queen's Square.\r\n",
      "You know Queen's Square?\"  Franklin bowed.  \"You must expect,\" continued\r\n",
      "Mr. Spencer, \"to meet with several disagreeable things, and a great deal\r\n",
      "of rough work, at your first setting out; but be faithful and obedient to\r\n",
      "your mistress, and obliging to your fellow-servants, and all will go\r\n",
      "well.  Mrs. Churchill will make you a very good mistress, if you behave\r\n",
      "properly; and I have no doubt but you will.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you will always--I mean, as long as you deserve it--find a friend in\r\n",
      "me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you, sir--I am sure you are--\"  There Franklin stopped short, for\r\n",
      "the recollection of all Mr. Spencer's goodness rushed upon him at once,\r\n",
      "and he could not say another word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bring me a candle to seal this letter,\" said his master; and he was very\r\n",
      "glad to get out of the room.  He came back with the candle, and, with a\r\n",
      "stout heart, stood by whilst the letter was sealing; and, when his master\r\n",
      "put it into his hand, said, in a cheerful voice, \"I hope you will let me\r\n",
      "see you again, sir, sometimes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly; whenever your mistress can spare you, I shall be very glad to\r\n",
      "see you; and remember, if ever you get into any difficulty, don't be\r\n",
      "afraid to come to me.  I have sometimes spoken harshly to you; but you\r\n",
      "will not meet with a more indulgent friend.\"  Franklin at this turned\r\n",
      "away with a full heart; and, after making two or three attempts to\r\n",
      "express his gratitude, left the room without being able to speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He got to Queen's Square about three o'clock.  The door was opened by a\r\n",
      "large, red-faced man, in a blue coat and scarlet waistcoat, to whom he\r\n",
      "felt afraid to give his message, lest he should not be a servant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what's your business, sir?\" said the butler.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have a letter for Mrs. Churchill, sir,\" said Franklin, endeavouring to\r\n",
      "pronounce his \"sir\" in a tone as respectful as the butler's was insolent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man having examined the direction, seal, and edges of the letter,\r\n",
      "carried it upstairs, and in a few minutes returned, and ordered Franklin\r\n",
      "to rub his shoes well and follow him.  He was then shown into a handsome\r\n",
      "room, where he found his mistress--an elderly lady.  She asked him a few\r\n",
      "questions, examining him attentively as she spoke; and her severe eye at\r\n",
      "first, and her gracious smile afterwards, made him feel that she was a\r\n",
      "person to be both loved and feared.  \"I shall give you in charge,\" said\r\n",
      "she, ringing a bell, \"to my housekeeper, and I hope she will have no\r\n",
      "reason to be displeased with you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The housekeeper, when she first came in, appeared with a smiling\r\n",
      "countenance; but the moment she cast her eyes on Franklin, it changed to\r\n",
      "a look of surprise and suspicion.  Her mistress recommended him to her\r\n",
      "protection, saying, \"Pomfret, I hope you will keep this boy under your\r\n",
      "own eye.\"  And she received him with a cold \"Very well, ma'am,\" which\r\n",
      "plainly showed that she was not disposed to like him.  In fact, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Pomfret was a woman so fond of power, and so jealous of favour, that she\r\n",
      "would have quarrelled with an angel who had got so near her mistress\r\n",
      "without her introduction.  She smothered her displeasure, however, till\r\n",
      "night; when, as she attended her mistress' toilette, she could not\r\n",
      "refrain from expressing her sentiments.  She began cautiously:  \"Ma'am,\r\n",
      "is not this the boy Mr. Spencer was talking of one day--that has been\r\n",
      "brought up by the VILLAINTROPIC SOCIETY, I think they call it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Philanthropic Society; yes,\" said her mistress; \"and my brother gives\r\n",
      "him a high character:  I hope he will do very well.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm sure I hope so too,\" observed Mrs. Pomfret; \"but I can't say; for my\r\n",
      "part, I've no great notion of those low people.  They say all those\r\n",
      "children are taken from the very lowest DRUGS and REFUGES of the town,\r\n",
      "and surely they are like enough, ma'am, to take after their own fathers\r\n",
      "and mothers.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But they are not suffered to be with their parents,\" rejoined the lady;\r\n",
      "\"and therefore cannot be hurt by their example.  This little boy, to be\r\n",
      "sure, was unfortunate in his father, but he has had an excellent\r\n",
      "education.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, EDICATION! to be sure, ma'am, I know.  I don't say but what\r\n",
      "edication is a great thing.  But then, ma'am, edication can't change the\r\n",
      "NATUR that's in one, they say; and one's that born naturally bad and low,\r\n",
      "they say, all the edication in the world won't do no good; and, for my\r\n",
      "part, ma'am, I know you knows best; but I should be afraid to let any of\r\n",
      "those Villaintropic folks get into my house; for nobody can tell the\r\n",
      "natur of them aforehand.  I declare it frights me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pomfret, I thought you had better sense:  how would this poor boy earn\r\n",
      "his bread? he would be forced to starve or steal, if everybody had such\r\n",
      "prejudices.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pomfret, who really was a good woman, was softened at this idea, and\r\n",
      "said, \"God forbid he should starve or steal, and God forbid I should say\r\n",
      "anything PREJUDICIARY of the boy; for there may be no harm in him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Mrs. Churchill, changing her tone, \"but, Pomfret, if we\r\n",
      "don't like the boy at the end of the month, we have done with him; for I\r\n",
      "have only promised Mr. Spencer to keep him a month upon trial:  there is\r\n",
      "no harm done.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear, no, ma'am, to be sure; and cook must put up with her\r\n",
      "disappointment, that's all.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What disappointment?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"About her nephew, ma'am; the boy she and I was speaking to you for.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The day you called her up about the almond pudding, ma'am.  If you\r\n",
      "remember, you said you should have no objections to try the boy; and upon\r\n",
      "that cook bought him new shirts; but they are to the good, as I tell\r\n",
      "her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I did not promise to take her nephew.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"O, no ma'am, not at all; she does not think to SAY THAT, else I should\r\n",
      "be very angry; but the poor woman never let fall a word, any more than\r\n",
      "frets that the boy should miss such a good place.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, but since I did say that I should have no objection to try him, I\r\n",
      "shall keep my word; let him come to-morrow.  Let them both have a fair\r\n",
      "trial, and at the end of the month I can decide which I like best, and\r\n",
      "which we had better keep.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dismissed with these orders, Mrs. Pomfret hastened to report all that had\r\n",
      "passed to the cook, like a favourite minister, proud to display the\r\n",
      "extent of her secret influence.  In the morning Felix, the cook's nephew,\r\n",
      "arrived; and, the moment he came into the kitchen, every eye, even the\r\n",
      "scullion's, was fixed upon him with approbation, and afterwards glanced\r\n",
      "upon Franklin with contempt--contempt which Franklin could not endure\r\n",
      "without some confusion, though quite unconscious of having deserved it;\r\n",
      "nor, upon the most impartial and cool self-examination, could he\r\n",
      "comprehend the justice of his judges.  He perceived indeed--for the\r\n",
      "comparisons were minutely made in audible and scornful whispers--that\r\n",
      "Felix was a much handsomer, or as the kitchen maid expressed it, a much\r\n",
      "more genteeler gentlemanly looking like sort of person than he was; and\r\n",
      "he was made to understand, that he wanted a frill to his shirt, a cravat,\r\n",
      "a pair of thin shoes, and, above all, shoe strings, besides other\r\n",
      "nameless advantages, which justly made his rival the admiration of the\r\n",
      "kitchen.  However, upon calling to mind all that his friend Mr. Spencer\r\n",
      "had ever said to him, he could not recollect his having warned him that\r\n",
      "shoe strings were indispensable requisites to the character of a good\r\n",
      "servant; so that he could only comfort himself with resolving, if\r\n",
      "possible, to make amends for these deficiencies, and to dissipate the\r\n",
      "prejudices which he saw were formed against him, by the strictest\r\n",
      "adherence to all that his tutor had taught him to be his duty.  He hoped\r\n",
      "to secure the approbation of his mistress by scrupulous obedience to all\r\n",
      "her commands, and faithful care of all that belonged to her.  At the same\r\n",
      "time he flattered himself he should win the goodwill of his fellow\r\n",
      "servants by showing a constant desire to oblige them.  He pursued this\r\n",
      "plan of conduct steadily for nearly three weeks, and found that he\r\n",
      "succeeded beyond his expectations in pleasing his mistress; but\r\n",
      "unfortunately he found it more difficult to please his fellow servants,\r\n",
      "and he sometimes offended when he least expected it.  He had made great\r\n",
      "progress in the affections of Corkscrew, the butler, by working indeed\r\n",
      "very hard for him, and doing every day at least half his business.  But\r\n",
      "one unfortunate night the butler was gone out; the bell rang:  he went\r\n",
      "upstairs; and his mistress asking where Corkscrew was, he answered that\r\n",
      "he was gone out.  \"Where to!\" said his mistress.  \"I don't know,\"\r\n",
      "answered Franklin.  And, as he had told exactly the truth, and meant to\r\n",
      "do no harm, he was surprised, at the butler's return, when he repeated to\r\n",
      "him what had passed, at receiving a sudden box on the ear, and the\r\n",
      "appellation of a mischievous, impertinent, mean-spirited brat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mischievous, impertinent, mean!\" repeated Franklin to himself; but,\r\n",
      "looking in the butler's face, which was a deeper scarlet than usual, he\r\n",
      "judged that he was far from sober, and did not doubt but that the next\r\n",
      "morning, when he came to the use of his reason, he would be sensible of\r\n",
      "his injustice, and apologize for his box of the ear.  But no apology\r\n",
      "coming all day, Franklin at last ventured to request an explanation, or\r\n",
      "rather, to ask what he had best do on the next occasion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why,\" said Corkscrew, \"when mistress asked for me, how came you to say I\r\n",
      "was gone out?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because, you know, I saw you go out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And when she asked you where I was gone, how came you to say that you\r\n",
      "did not know?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Because, indeed, I did not.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You are a stupid blockhead! could you not say I was gone to the\r\n",
      "washerwoman's?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But WERE you?\" said Franklin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Was I?\" cried Corkscrew, and looked as if he would have struck him\r\n",
      "again; \"how dare you give me the lie, Mr. Hypocrite?  You would be ready\r\n",
      "enough, I'll be bound, to make excuses for yourself.  Why are not\r\n",
      "mistress' clogs cleaned?  Go along and blacken 'em, this minute, and send\r\n",
      "Felix to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From this time forward Felix alone was privileged to enter the butler's\r\n",
      "pantry.  Felix became the favourite of Corkscrew; and, though Franklin by\r\n",
      "no means sought to pry into the mysteries of their private conferences,\r\n",
      "nor ever entered without knocking at the door, yet it was his fate once\r\n",
      "to be sent of a message at an unlucky time; and, as the door was half\r\n",
      "open, he could not avoid seeing Felix drinking a bumper of red liquor,\r\n",
      "which he could not help suspecting to be wine; and, as the decanter,\r\n",
      "which usually went upstairs after dinner, was at this time in the\r\n",
      "butler's grasp, without any stopper in it, he was involuntarily forced to\r\n",
      "suspect they were drinking his mistress' wine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor were the bumpers of port the only unlawful rewards which Felix\r\n",
      "received:  his aunt, the cook, had occasion for his assistance, and she\r\n",
      "had many delicious douceurs in her gift.  Many a handful of currants,\r\n",
      "many a half-custard, many a triangular remnant of pie, besides the choice\r\n",
      "of his own meal at breakfast, dinner and supper, fell to the share of the\r\n",
      "favourite Felix; whilst Franklin was neglected, though he took the utmost\r\n",
      "pains to please the cook in all honourable service, and, when she was\r\n",
      "hot, angry, or hurried, he was always at hand to help her; and in the\r\n",
      "hour of adversity, when the clock struck five, and no dinner was dished,\r\n",
      "and no kitchen maid with twenty pair of hands was to be had, Franklin\r\n",
      "would answer to her call, with flowers to garnish her dishes, and\r\n",
      "presence of mind to know, in the midst of the commotion, where everything\r\n",
      "that was wanting was to be found; so that, quick as lightning, all\r\n",
      "difficulties vanished before him.  Yet when the danger was over, and the\r\n",
      "hour of adversity had past, the ungrateful cook would forget her\r\n",
      "benefactor, and, when it came to his supper time, would throw him, with a\r\n",
      "carelessness that touched him sensibly, anything which the other servants\r\n",
      "were too nice to eat.  All this Franklin bore with fortitude; nor did he\r\n",
      "envy Felix the dainties which he ate, sometimes close beside him:  \"For,\"\r\n",
      "said he to himself, \"I have a clear conscience, and that is more than\r\n",
      "Felix can have.  I know how he wins cook's favour too well, and I fancy I\r\n",
      "know how I have offended her; for since the day I saw the basket, she has\r\n",
      "done nothing but huff me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The history of the basket was this.  Mrs. Pomfret, the housekeeper, had\r\n",
      "several times, directly and indirectly, given the world below to\r\n",
      "understand that she and her mistress thought there was a prodigious\r\n",
      "quantity of meat eaten of late.  Now, when she spoke, it was usually at\r\n",
      "dinner time; she always looked, or Franklin imagined that she looked,\r\n",
      "suspiciously at him.  Other people looked more maliciously; but, as he\r\n",
      "felt himself perfectly innocent, he went on eating his dinner in silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But at length it was time to explain.  One Sunday there appeared a\r\n",
      "handsome sirloin of beef, which before noon on Monday had shrunk almost\r\n",
      "to the bare bone, and presented such a deplorable spectacle to the\r\n",
      "opening eyes of Mrs. Pomfret that her long smothered indignation burst\r\n",
      "forth, and she boldly declared she was now certain there had been foul\r\n",
      "play, and she would have the beef found, or she would know why.  She\r\n",
      "spoke, but no beef appeared, till Franklin, with a look of sudden\r\n",
      "recollection, cried, \"Did not I see something like a piece of beef in a\r\n",
      "basket in the dairy?--I think--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cook, as if somebody had smote her a deadly blow, grew pale; but,\r\n",
      "suddenly recovering the use of her speech, turned upon Franklin, and,\r\n",
      "with a voice of thunder, gave him the lie direct; and forthwith, taking\r\n",
      "Mrs. Pomfret by the ruffle, led the way to the dairy, declaring she could\r\n",
      "defy the world--\"that so she could, and would.\"  \"There, ma'am,\" said she\r\n",
      "kicking an empty basket which lay on the floor--\"there's malice for you.\r\n",
      "Ask him why he don't show you the beef in the basket.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought I saw--\" poor Franklin began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You thought you saw!\" cried the cook, coming close up to him with\r\n",
      "kimboed arms, and looking like a dragon; \"and pray, sir, what business\r\n",
      "has such a one as you to think you see?  And pray, ma'am, will you be\r\n",
      "pleased to speak--perhaps, ma'am, he'll condescend to obey you--ma'am,\r\n",
      "will you be pleased to forbid him my dairy? for here he comes prying and\r\n",
      "spying about; and how, ma'am, am I to answer for my butter and cream, or\r\n",
      "anything at all?  I'm sure it's what I can't pretend to, unless you do me\r\n",
      "the justice to forbid him my places.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Pomfret, whose eyes were blinded by her prejudices against the folks\r\n",
      "of the \"Villaintropic Society,\" and also by her secret jealousy of a boy\r\n",
      "whom she deemed to be a growing favourite of her mistress', took part\r\n",
      "with the cook, and ended, as she began, with a firm persuasion that\r\n",
      "Franklin was the guilty person.  \"Let him alone, let him alone!\" said\r\n",
      "she; \"he has as many turns and windings as a hare; but we shall catch him\r\n",
      "yet, I'll be bound, in some of his doublings.  I knew the nature of him\r\n",
      "well enough, from the first time I ever set my eyes upon him; but\r\n",
      "mistress shall have her own way, and see the end of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These words, and the bitter sense of injustice, drew tears at length fast\r\n",
      "down the proud cheek of Franklin, which might possibly have touched Mrs.\r\n",
      "Pomfret, if Felix, with a sneer, had not called them CROCODILE TEARS.\r\n",
      "\"Felix, too!\" thought he; \"this is too much.\"  In fact, Felix had till\r\n",
      "now professed himself his firm ally, and had on his part received from\r\n",
      "Franklin unequivocal proofs of friendship; for it must be told that every\r\n",
      "other morning, when it was Felix's turn to get breakfast, Felix never was\r\n",
      "up in decent time, and must inevitably have come to public disgrace if\r\n",
      "Franklin had not got all the breakfast things ready for him, the bread\r\n",
      "and butter spread, and the toast toasted; and had not, moreover,\r\n",
      "regularly, when the clock struck eight, and Mrs. Pomfret's foot was heard\r\n",
      "overhead, run to call the sleeping Felix, and helped him constantly\r\n",
      "through the hurry of getting dressed one instant before the housekeeper\r\n",
      "came downstairs.  All this could not but be present to his memory; but,\r\n",
      "seeming to reproach him, Franklin wiped away his crocodile tears, and\r\n",
      "preserved a magnanimous silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hour of retribution was, however, not so far off as Felix imagined.\r\n",
      "Cunning people may go on cleverly in their devices for some time; but\r\n",
      "although they may escape once, twice, perhaps ninety-nine times, what\r\n",
      "does that signify?--for the hundredth time they come to shame, and lose\r\n",
      "all their character.  Grown bold by frequent success, Felix became more\r\n",
      "careless in his operations; and it happened that one day he met his\r\n",
      "mistress full in the passage, as he was going on one of the cook's secret\r\n",
      "errands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where are you going, Felix?\" said his mistress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To the washerwoman's, ma'am,\" answered he, with his usual effrontery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well,\" said she.  \"Call at the bookseller's in--stay, I must write\r\n",
      "down the direction.  Pomfret,\" said she, opening the housekeeper's room\r\n",
      "door, \"have you a bit of paper?\"  Pomfret came with the writing-paper,\r\n",
      "and looked very angry to see that Felix was going out without her\r\n",
      "knowledge; so, while Mrs. Churchill was writing the direction, she stood\r\n",
      "talking to him about it; whilst he, in the greatest terror imaginable,\r\n",
      "looked up in her face as she spoke; but was all the time intent on\r\n",
      "parrying on the other side the attacks of a little French dog of his\r\n",
      "mistress', which, unluckily for him, had followed her into the passage.\r\n",
      "Manchon was extremely fond of Felix, who, by way of pleasing his\r\n",
      "mistress, had paid most assiduous court to her dog; yet now his caresses\r\n",
      "were rather troublesome.  Manchon leaped up, and was not to be rebuffed.\r\n",
      "\"Poor fellow--poor fellow--down! down!  poor fellow!\" cried Felix, and\r\n",
      "put him away.  But Manchon leaped up again, and began smelling near the\r\n",
      "fatal pocket in a most alarming manner.  \"You will see by this direction\r\n",
      "where you are to go,\" said his mistress.  \"Manchon, come here--and you\r\n",
      "will be so good as to bring me--down! down! Manchon, be quiet!\"  But\r\n",
      "Manchon knew better--he had now got his head into Felix's pocket, and\r\n",
      "would not be quiet till he had drawn from thence, rustling out of its\r\n",
      "brown paper, half a cold turkey, which had been missing since morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My cold turkey, as I'm alive!\" exclaimed the housekeeper, darting upon\r\n",
      "it with horror and amazement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is all this?\" said Mrs. Churchill, in a composed voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't know, ma'am,\" answered Felix, so confused that he knew not what\r\n",
      "to say; \"but--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But what?\" cried Mrs. Pomfret, indignation flashing from her eyes.  \"But\r\n",
      "what?\" repeated his mistress, waiting for his reply with a calm air of\r\n",
      "attention, which still more disconcerted Felix; for, though with an angry\r\n",
      "person he might have some chance of escape, he knew that he could not\r\n",
      "invent any excuse in such circumstances, which could stand the\r\n",
      "examination of a person in her sober senses.  He was struck dumb.\r\n",
      "\"Speak,\" said Mrs. Churchill, in a still lower tone; \"I am ready to hear\r\n",
      "all you have to say.  In my house everybody shall have justice; speak--\r\n",
      "but what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"BUT,\" stammered Felix; and, after in vain attempting to equivocate,\r\n",
      "confessed that he was going to take the turkey to his cousin's; but he\r\n",
      "threw all the blame upon his aunt, the cook, who, he said, had ordered\r\n",
      "him upon this expedition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cook was now summoned; but she totally denied all knowledge of the\r\n",
      "affair, with the same violence with which she had lately confounded\r\n",
      "Franklin about the beef in the basket; not entirely, however, with the\r\n",
      "same success; for Felix, perceiving by his mistress' eye that she was on\r\n",
      "the point of desiring him to leave the house immediately; and not being\r\n",
      "very willing to leave a place in which he had lived so well with the\r\n",
      "butler, did not hesitate to confront his aunt with assurance equal to her\r\n",
      "own.  He knew how to bring his charge home to her.  He produced a note in\r\n",
      "her own handwriting, the purport of which was to request her cousin's\r\n",
      "acceptance of \"some DELICATE COLD TURKEY,\" and to beg she would send her,\r\n",
      "by the return of the bearer, a little of her cherry-brandy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Churchill coolly wrote upon the back of the note her cook's\r\n",
      "discharge, and informed Felix she had no further occasion for his\r\n",
      "services, but, upon his pleading with many tears, which Franklin did not\r\n",
      "call CROCODILE TEARS, that he was so young, that he was under the\r\n",
      "dominion of his aunt, he touched Mrs. Pomfret's compassion, and she\r\n",
      "obtained for him permission to stay till the end of the month, to give\r\n",
      "him yet a chance of redeeming his character.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Pomfret now seeing how far she had been imposed upon, resolved, for\r\n",
      "the future, to be more upon her guard with Felix, and felt that she had\r\n",
      "treated Franklin with great injustice, when she accused him of\r\n",
      "malpractices about the sirloin of beef.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Good people, when they are made sensible that they have treated anyone\r\n",
      "with injustice, are impatient to have an opportunity to rectify their\r\n",
      "mistake; and Mrs. Pomfret was now prepared to see everything which\r\n",
      "Franklin did in the most favourable point of view; especially as the next\r\n",
      "day she discovered that it was he who every morning boiled the water for\r\n",
      "her tea, and buttered her toast--services for which she had always\r\n",
      "thought she was indebted to Felix.  Besides, she had rated Felix's\r\n",
      "abilities very highly, because he made up her weekly accounts for her;\r\n",
      "but unluckily once, when Franklin was out of the way, and she brought a\r\n",
      "bill in a hurry to her favourite to cast up, she discovered that he did\r\n",
      "not know how to cast up pounds, shillings and pence, and he was obliged\r\n",
      "to confess that she must wait till Franklin came home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, passing over a number of small incidents which gradually unfolded\r\n",
      "the character of the two boys, we must proceed to a more serious affair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Corkscrew frequently, after he had finished taking away supper, and after\r\n",
      "the housekeeper was gone to bed, sallied forth to a neighbouring alehouse\r\n",
      "to drink with his friends.  The alehouse was kept by that cousin of\r\n",
      "Felix's, who was so fond of \"DELICATE cold turkey,\" and who had such\r\n",
      "choice cherry-brandy.  Corkscrew kept the key of the house door, so that\r\n",
      "he could return home whenever he thought proper; and, if he should by\r\n",
      "accident be called for by his mistress after supper, Felix knew where to\r\n",
      "find him, and did not scruple to make any of those excuses which poor\r\n",
      "Franklin had too much integrity to use.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All these precautions taken, the butler was at liberty to indulge his\r\n",
      "favourite passion, which so increased with indulgence, that his wages\r\n",
      "were by no means sufficient to support him in this way of life.  Every\r\n",
      "day he felt less resolution to break through his bad habits; for every\r\n",
      "day drinking became more necessary to him.  His health was ruined.  With\r\n",
      "a red, pimpled, bloated face, emaciated legs, and a swelled, diseased\r\n",
      "body, he appeared the victim of intoxication.  In the morning, when he\r\n",
      "got up, his hands trembled, his spirits flagged, he could do nothing\r\n",
      "until he had taken a dram--an operation which he was obliged to repeat\r\n",
      "several times in the course of the day, as all those wretched people MUST\r\n",
      "who once acquire this habit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had run up a long bill at the alehouse which he frequented; and the\r\n",
      "landlord, who grew urgent for his money, refused to give further credit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One night, when Corkscrew had drunk enough only to make him fretful, he\r\n",
      "leaned with his elbow surlily upon the table, began to quarrel with the\r\n",
      "landlord, and swore that he had not of late treated him like a gentleman.\r\n",
      "To which the landlord coolly replied, \"That as long as he had paid like a\r\n",
      "gentleman, he had been treated like one, and that was as much as anyone\r\n",
      "could expect, or, at any rate, as much as anyone would meet with in this\r\n",
      "world.\"  For the truth of this assertion he appealed, laughing, to a\r\n",
      "party of men who were drinking in the room.  The men, however, took part\r\n",
      "with Corkscrew, and, drawing him over to their table, made him sit down\r\n",
      "with them.  They were in high good-humour, and the butler soon grew so\r\n",
      "intimate with them, that, in the openness of his heart, he soon\r\n",
      "communicated to them, not only all his own affairs, but all that he knew,\r\n",
      "and more than all that he knew, of his mistress'.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His new friends were by no means uninterested by his conversation, and\r\n",
      "encouraged him as much as possible to talk; for they had secret views,\r\n",
      "which the butler was by no means sufficiently sober to discover.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Churchill had some fine old family plate; and these men belonged to\r\n",
      "a gang of housebreakers.  Before they parted with Corkscrew, they engaged\r\n",
      "him to meet them again the next night; their intimacy was still more\r\n",
      "closely cemented.  One of the men actually offered to lend Corkscrew\r\n",
      "three guineas towards the payment of his debt, and hinted that, if he\r\n",
      "thought proper, he could easily get the whole cleared off.  Upon this\r\n",
      "hint, Corkscrew became all attention, till, after some hesitation on\r\n",
      "their part, and repeated promises of secrecy on his, they at length\r\n",
      "disclosed their plans to him.  They gave him to understand, that if he\r\n",
      "would assist in letting them into his mistress' house, they would let him\r\n",
      "have an ample share in the booty.  The butler, who had the reputation of\r\n",
      "being an honest man, and indeed whose integrity had hitherto been proof\r\n",
      "against everything but his mistress' port, turned pale, and trembled at\r\n",
      "this proposal; drank two or three bumpers to drown thought; and promised\r\n",
      "to give an answer the next day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went home more than half-intoxicated.  His mind was so full of what\r\n",
      "had passed, that he could not help bragging to Felix, whom he found awake\r\n",
      "at his return, that he could have his bill paid off at the alehouse\r\n",
      "whenever he pleased; dropping, besides, some hints, which were not lost\r\n",
      "upon Felix.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the morning Felix reminded him of the things which he had said; and\r\n",
      "Corkscrew, alarmed, endeavoured to evade his questions, by saying that he\r\n",
      "was not in his senses when he talked in that manner.  Nothing, however,\r\n",
      "that he could urge made any impression upon Felix, whose recollection on\r\n",
      "the subject was perfectly distinct, and who had too much cunning himself,\r\n",
      "and too little confidence in his companion, to be the dupe of his\r\n",
      "dissimulation.  The butler knew not what to do when he saw that Felix was\r\n",
      "absolutely determined either to betray their scheme, or to become a\r\n",
      "sharer in the booty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next night came, and he was now to make a final decision; either to\r\n",
      "determine on breaking off entirely with his new acquaintances, or taking\r\n",
      "Felix with him to join in the plot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His debt, his love of drinking, the impossibility of indulging it without\r\n",
      "a fresh supply of money, all came into his mind at once, and conquered\r\n",
      "his remaining scruples.  It is said by those whose fatal experience gives\r\n",
      "them a right to be believed, that a drunkard will sacrifice anything,\r\n",
      "everything, sooner than the pleasure of habitual intoxication.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How much easier is it never to begin a bad custom than to break through\r\n",
      "it when once formed!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hour of rendezvous came, and Corkscrew went to the alehouse, where he\r\n",
      "found the housebreakers waiting for him, and a glass of brandy ready\r\n",
      "poured out.  He sighed--drank--hesitated--drank again--heard the landlord\r\n",
      "talk of his bill, saw the money produced which would pay it in a moment--\r\n",
      "drank again--cursed himself, and, giving his hand to the villain who was\r\n",
      "whispering in his ear, swore that he could not help it, and must do as\r\n",
      "they would have him.  They required of him to give up the key of the\r\n",
      "house door, that they might get another made by it.  He had left it with\r\n",
      "Felix, and was now obliged to explain the new difficulty which had\r\n",
      "arisen.  Felix knew enough to ruin them, and must therefore be won over.\r\n",
      "This was no very difficult task; he had a strong desire to have some\r\n",
      "worked cravats, and the butler knew enough of him to believe that this\r\n",
      "would be a sufficient bribe.  The cravats were bought and shown to Felix.\r\n",
      "He thought them the only things wanting to make him a complete, fine\r\n",
      "gentleman; and to go without them, especially when he had once seen\r\n",
      "himself in the glass with one tied on in a splendid bow, appeared\r\n",
      "impossible.  Even this paltry temptation, working upon his vanity, at\r\n",
      "length prevailed with a boy whose integrity had long been corrupted by\r\n",
      "the habits of petty pilfering and daily falsehood.  It was agreed that,\r\n",
      "the first time his mistress sent him out on a message, he should carry\r\n",
      "the key of the house door to his cousin's, and deliver it into the hands\r\n",
      "of one of the gang, who were there in waiting for it.  Such was the\r\n",
      "scheme.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Felix, the night after all this had been planned, went to bed, and fell\r\n",
      "fast asleep; but the butler, who had not yet stifled the voice of\r\n",
      "conscience, felt, in the silence of the night, so insupportably\r\n",
      "miserable, that, instead of going to rest, he stole softly into the\r\n",
      "pantry for a bottle of his mistress' wine, and there drinking glass after\r\n",
      "glass, he stayed till he became so far intoxicated, that, though he\r\n",
      "contrived to find his way back to bed, he could by no means undress\r\n",
      "himself.  Without any power of recollection, he flung himself upon the\r\n",
      "bed, leaving his candle half hanging out of the candlestick beside him.\r\n",
      "Franklin slept in the next room to him, and presently awaking, thought he\r\n",
      "perceived a strong smell of something burning.  He jumped up, and seeing\r\n",
      "a light under the butler's door, gently opened it, and to his\r\n",
      "astonishment, beheld one of the bed curtains in flames.  He immediately\r\n",
      "ran to the butler, and pulled him with all his force, to rouse him from\r\n",
      "his lethargy.  He came to his senses at length, but was so terrified, and\r\n",
      "so helpless, that, if it had not been for Franklin, the whole house would\r\n",
      "soon inevitably have been on fire.  Felix, trembling and cowardly, knew\r\n",
      "not what to do; and it was curious to see him obeying Franklin, whose\r\n",
      "turn it now was to command.  Franklin ran upstairs to awaken Mrs.\r\n",
      "Pomfret, whose terror of fire was so great that she came from her room\r\n",
      "almost out of her senses, whilst he, with the greatest presence of mind,\r\n",
      "recollected where he had seen two large tubs of water, which the maids\r\n",
      "had prepared the night before for their washing, and seizing the wet\r\n",
      "linen which had been left to soak, he threw them upon the flames.  He\r\n",
      "exerted himself with so much good sense, that the fire was presently\r\n",
      "extinguished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everything was now once more safe and quiet.  Mrs. Pomfret, recovering\r\n",
      "from her fright, postponed all inquiries till the morning, and rejoiced\r\n",
      "that her mistress had not been awakened, whilst Corkscrew flattered\r\n",
      "himself that he should be able to conceal the true cause of the accident.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't you tell Mrs. Pomfret where you found the candle when you came\r\n",
      "into the room,\" said he to Franklin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If she asks me, you know I must tell the truth,\" replied he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Must!\" repeated Felix, sneeringly; \"what, you MUST be a tell-tale!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I never told any tales of anybody, and I should be very sorry to get\r\n",
      "anyone into a scrape; but for all that I shall not tell a lie, either for\r\n",
      "myself or anybody else, let you call me what names you will.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But if I were to give you something that you would like,\" said\r\n",
      "Corkscrew--\"something that I know you would like!\" repeated Felix.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing you can give me will do,\" answered Franklin, steadily, \"so it is\r\n",
      "useless to say any more about it--I hope I shall not be questioned.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this hope he was mistaken; for the first thing Mrs. Pomfret did in the\r\n",
      "morning was to come into the room to examine and deplore the burnt\r\n",
      "curtains, whilst Corkscrew stood by, endeavouring to exculpate himself by\r\n",
      "all the excuses he could invent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Pomfret, however, though sometimes blinded by her prejudices, was no\r\n",
      "fool; and it was absolutely impossible to make her believe that a candle,\r\n",
      "which had been left on the hearth, where Corkscrew protested he had left\r\n",
      "it, could have set curtains on fire which were at least six feet distant.\r\n",
      "Turning short round to Franklin, she desired that he would show her where\r\n",
      "he found the candle when he came into the room.  He took up the\r\n",
      "candlestick; but the moment the housekeeper cast her eye upon it, she\r\n",
      "snatched it from his hands; \"How did this candlestick come here?  This\r\n",
      "was not the candlestick you found here last night,\" cried she.  \"Yes,\r\n",
      "indeed it was,\" answered Franklin.  \"That is impossible,\" retorted she,\r\n",
      "vehemently, \"for I left this candlestick with my own hands last night, in\r\n",
      "the hall, the last thing I did, after you,\" said she, turning to the\r\n",
      "butler, \"was gone to bed--I'm sure of it--Nay, don't you recollect my\r\n",
      "taking this JAPANNED CANDLESTICK out of your hand, and making you to go\r\n",
      "up to bed with the brass one, and I bolted the door at the stair-head\r\n",
      "after you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was all very true; but Corkscrew had afterwards gone down from his\r\n",
      "room by a back staircase, unbolted that door, and, upon his return from\r\n",
      "the alehouse, had taken the japanned candlestick by mistake upstairs, and\r\n",
      "had left the brass one in its stead upon the hall table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, ma'am,\" said Felix, \"indeed you forget; for Mr. Corkscrew came into\r\n",
      "my room to desire me to call him betimes in the morning, and I happened\r\n",
      "to take particular notice, and he had the japanned candlestick in his\r\n",
      "hand, and that was just as I heard you, bolting the door. Indeed, ma'am\r\n",
      "you forget.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Indeed, sir,\" retorted Mrs. Pomfret, rising in anger, \"I do not forget;\r\n",
      "I'm not come to be SUPPERANNUATED yet, I hope.  How do you dare to tell\r\n",
      "me I forget?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, ma'am,\" cried Felix, \"I beg your pardon, I did not--I did not mean\r\n",
      "to say you forgot, but only I thought, perhaps, you might not\r\n",
      "particularly remember; for if you please to recollect--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I won't please to recollect just whatever you please, sir!  Hold your\r\n",
      "tongue; why should you poke yourself into this scrape; what have you to\r\n",
      "do with it, I should be glad to know?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing in the world, oh nothing in the world; I'm sure I beg your\r\n",
      "pardon, ma'am,\" answered Felix, in a soft tone; and, sneaking off, left\r\n",
      "his friend Corkscrew to fight his own battle, secretly resolving to\r\n",
      "desert in good time, if he saw any danger of the alehouse transactions\r\n",
      "coming to light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Corkscrew could make but very blundering excuses for himself and,\r\n",
      "conscious of guilt, he turned pale, and appeared so much more terrified\r\n",
      "than butlers usually appear when detected in a lie, that Mrs. Pomfret\r\n",
      "resolved, as she said, to sift the matter to the bottom.  Impatiently did\r\n",
      "she wait till the clock struck nine, and her mistress' bell rang, the\r\n",
      "signal for her attendance at her levee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How do you find yourself this morning, ma'am?\" said she, undrawing the\r\n",
      "curtains.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very sleepy, indeed,\" answered her mistress in a drowsy voice; \"I think\r\n",
      "I must sleep half an hour longer--shut the curtains.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As you please, ma'am; but I suppose I had better open a little of the\r\n",
      "window shutter, for it's past nine.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But just struck.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh dear, ma'am, it struck before I came upstairs, and you know we are\r\n",
      "twenty minutes slow--Lord bless us!\" exclaimed Mrs. Pomfret, as she let\r\n",
      "fall the bar of the window, which roused her mistress.  \"I'm sure I beg\r\n",
      "your pardon a thousand times--it's only the bar--because I had this great\r\n",
      "key in my hand.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Put down the key, then, or you'll knock something else down; and you may\r\n",
      "open the shutters now; for I'm quite awake.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dear me! I'm so sorry to think of disturbing you,\" cried Mrs. Pomfret,\r\n",
      "at the same time throwing the shutters wide open; \"but, to be sure,\r\n",
